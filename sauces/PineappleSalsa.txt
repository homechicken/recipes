Pineapple Salsa
To cut down on the cutting, we leaned on the food processor.

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

For this recipe, we pulled out the food processor to help with the heavy chopping. We used pineapple as the base of our salsa and finished it by stirring in some jalapeño chiles, fresh cilantro, red onion, garlic, lime juice, oil, salt, and pepper.
