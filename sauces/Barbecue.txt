Barbecue Sauce

Theory: tomato base + sweet + salty + spicy + smoky + acidic

Onions and garlic, cook down until golden brown and fragrant
Cook low and slow
De-glaze the pan with light lager or water, wine, whiskey, bourbon, etc
Reduce deglazing liquid.

Add tomato base (tomato paste thinned with water, or tomato sauce/puree. Avoid ketchup)

Sweet: molasses, maple syrup, dark brown sugar, honey

Salty: kosher salt (smoked), Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki, soy sauce

Spicy: red pepper flakes, tabasco, ground cayenne

Smoky: smoked paprika, smoked salt (avoid liquid smoke)

Acidic: apple cider vinegar, lemon juice


Simmer 30-45 minutes until reduced, thick enough but still pourable.

Pineapple, or pineapple juice for sweetness and acidity? Hawaiian style?
tomato paste thinned with pineapple juice, worcestershire, molasses, apple cider vinegar, garlic, smoked salt.
