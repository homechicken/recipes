Barbecue Sauce

Theory: tomato base + sweet + salty + spicy + smoky + acidic

Onions and garlic, cook down until golden brown and fragrant
Cook low and slow
De-glaze the pan with light lager or water, wine, whiskey, bourbon, etc
Reduce deglazing liquid.

Add tomato base (tomato paste thinned with water, or tomato sauce/puree. Avoid ketchup)

Sweet: molasses, maple syrup, dark brown sugar, honey

Salty: kosher salt (smoked), Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki, soy sauce

Spicy: red pepper flakes, tabasco, ground cayenne

Smoky: smoked paprika, smoked salt (avoid liquid smoke)

Acidic: apple cider vinegar, lemon juice


Simmer 30-45 minutes until reduced, thick enough but still pourable.
