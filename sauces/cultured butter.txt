Cultured butter

makes about 2 cups, and 2 cups buttermilk
can take up to 1 week

4 c heavy cream
2 T buttermilk
1/4 t salt, optional

Combine cream and buttermilk in clean, lidded container. Cover container and let sit at room temperature until mixture smells tangy and buttery and thickens to sour cream-like consistency, at least 24 hours or up to 1 week.

Chill cream mixture to 55-60 degrees.

Process cream mixture in food processor until mixture turns from grainy whipped cream to lumps of butter splashing in liquid, 1-3 minutes. Stop processor immediately.

Fill medium bowl halfway with ice and water. Line fine-mesh strainer with triple layer of cheesecloth, leaving a few inches of cloth hanging over the sides of the strainer and set over a large bowl. Drain butter mixture in prepared strainer (buttermilk will collect in bowl). Lift cheesecloth by the edges and twist and squeeze tightly over strainer to press out more buttermilk. Stop when butter starts to squeeze through cheesecloth. Transfer cheesecloth-wrapped butter to ice bath until firm around the exterior, about 2 minutes. Transfer buttermilk to airtight container.

Remove butter from cheesecloth and transfer to empty bowl. Stir and press with wooden spoon (a metal one will conduct heat from your hands) to force out additional buttermilk from butter, 1-2 minutes. Drain buttermilk from bowl, add to buttermilk container and refrigerate until ready to use. Knead salt (if using) into butter with wooden spoon. Transfer butter to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. Can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.
