Oshitashi
Serves 4

8 oz greens (spinach, Swiss chard, kale, or mustard greens) stemmed and cut into 2" pieces
kosher salt
1/2t hondashi dissolved in 1/2c hot water (or 1/2c dashi)
1/2 t mirin
1 1/2t soy sauce
2t toasted sesame seeds for garnish

Blanch the greens in a large pot of boiling, lightly-salted water until wilted, about 1 minute. Drain and set aside in a colander/strainer. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the greens dry.

Whisk together the hondashi, mirin, and soy sauce in a large bowl.

Fold in the greens. Cover and chill for 1-24 hours.

Reserving the marinade, use clean hands to squeeze the marinade out of the greens--they don't need to be dry, but they shouldn't be dripping wet either. Pile the greens in little bowls, drizzle with a small spoonful of the reserved marinade, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve chilled.
