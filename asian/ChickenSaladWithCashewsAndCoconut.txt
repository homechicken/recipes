Southeast Asian Chicken Salad with Cashews and Coconut

Don't use shallots that are past their prime—they should be firm and crisp, not soft and spongy. If none are available, use ½ small red onion, thinly sliced. Don't chop the herbs. Left in larger pieces, they have more presence in the salad, both visually and flavor-wise. And don't add the herbs until you are ready to serve, in order to keep them as bright and fresh as possible.

Serves 6-8
A rotisserie chicken is perfect for this salad.

⅓ cup unsweetened wide-flake coconut
2 Fresno or jalapeño chilies, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced
3 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
⅓ cup lime juice
¼ cup fish sauce
2½ teaspoons white sugar
2 medium shallots, halved and thinly sliced
3 cups shredded cooked chicken (see note)
¼ medium head green or red cabbage (14 ounces), cored and shredded (about 2 cups)
½ cup roasted cashews, roughly chopped
2 cups lightly packed fresh basil, torn
2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves

DIRECTIONS
In a small skillet over medium, toast the coconut, stirring frequently, until light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.

In a blender, combine half of the sliced chilies, the garlic, lime juice, fish sauce and sugar. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl, add the shallots and chicken and let stand for 10 minutes.

Add the cabbage and toss with your hands to combine, gently rubbing the dressing into the shreds. Add the remaining sliced chilies, the cashews and coconut, then toss. Add the basil and cilantro and gently toss again.
