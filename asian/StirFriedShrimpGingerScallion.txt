Stir-Fried Shrimp with Scallion-Ginger Sauce

We wanted a shrimp stir-fry with plump, juicy, and tender shrimp and a vibrant sauce.

Serves 4

For efficiency, prep the stir-fry ingredients while the shrimp stands. Serve with rice.

1 pound extra-large (21-25) shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed
2 teaspoons sugar
½ teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 (5-inch) piece ginger, peeled
½ cup water
6 large scallions, greens parts cut into 1-inch pieces and white part cut into ½-inch pieces
1/4 cup Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
½ teaspoon ground white pepper
3 carrots, peeled and sliced on bias ¼-inch thick
6 celery ribs, sliced on bias ¼-inch thick

1. Combine shrimp, 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, and cornstarch in medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. Divide ginger into 1 2-inch piece and 1 3-inch piece. Cut 3-inch piece into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Process ginger rounds, water, scallion whites, rice wine or sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon sugar in blender until smooth, 30 seconds. Strain mixture through fine-meshed strainer into bowl, pressing on solids to remove liquid. Discard solids. Cut remaining 2-inch piece ginger into thin matchsticks.

3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil, ginger matchstick, and white pepper in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until ginger is just beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

4. Add strained ginger mixture and shrimp and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Add scallion greens, and toss to combine. Transfer to serving dish, and serve.
