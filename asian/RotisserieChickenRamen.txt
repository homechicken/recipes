Rotisserie Chicken Ramen
serves 4

1 rotisserie chicken, whole or leftover
4 scallions
1 piece 1" ginger, thinly sliced
1 small carrot, optional
1 dried shiitake mushroom
3 slices bacon
12 c water
4 portions ramen noodles (preferably fresh)
8 t soy sauce
2 cooked eggs, halved

Harvest meat from the rotisserie chicken, don't worry about getting every bit, go for the bigger pieces and leave the rest for the broth. Pull or slice the meat into bite-sized pieces and reserve in the fridge while you make the broth.

Break the chicken carcass into a few pieces and put them in a stockpot. Trim the roots and dark green sparts of the scallions and add them to the pot. Thinly slice the white and tender green parts and reserve to garnish the soup. Add the ginger, carrot (if using), shiitake, and bacon. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a rollicking simmer and skim any froth that collects on the surface during the first 10 minutes.

Cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3, to 8 cups, about 2 hours. Strain the broth. Slice the shiitake and use for garnish if you like. The broth can be refrigerated at this point for up to 2 days.

to serve:
Bring broth to a simmer and cook the ramen noodles according to package directions. Drain the noodles well and portion them out among 4 bowls. Top with broth. Season each bowl with 2 t soy sauce, a portion of the reserved chicken meat, scallions, half an egg, and whatever else you have.
