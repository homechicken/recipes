Soy Sauce Kimchi
Makes 1 quart

1lb napa cabbage, cut into 1" piecese
1/2 Asian pear or 1 medium apple, grated
1/2 c chopped scallions
1 1/2 T julienned fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, grated
1 1/2 t chili flakes
1 T sugar
kosher salt
1/2 c soy sauce
1/2 c water

Toss the cabbage, fruit, scallions, ginger, garlic, and chili flakes in a large bowl. Sprinkle the sugar and salt over the mixture and massage it. You want the cabbage to wilt until it occupies about half the volume it did when you started. Add the soy sauce and water.

Transfer the kimchi and all liquid to a gallon-sized ziploc bag, pressing to remove all air. Chill for at least 1 hour for the flavors to meld and develop. Kimchi can be prepared 3 days in advance and refrigerated until ready to serve.
