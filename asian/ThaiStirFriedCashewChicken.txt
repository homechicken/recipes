Thai Stir-Fried Chicken with Cashews

4 servings, 30 minutes

5 medium garlic cloves, finely grated
3 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
ground white pepper
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 small red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and sliced into thin strips
1 bunch scallions, cut into 1-inch lengths
1/2 cup roasted cashews

DIRECTIONS
In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, pepper flakes and ¾ teaspoon white pepper. Stir in the chicken, then marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Drain the chicken in a fine mesh strainer set over a medium bowl, pressing the chicken to remove excess marinade. Stir ¼ cup water into the marinade and set aside.

In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the oil until barely smoking. Add the chicken in an even layer, then cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the bell pepper, scallions and cashews. Stir the marinade mixture to recombine, add to the pan and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Cook, stirring often, until the liquid thickens and clings to the chicken, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with white pepper.

Tip: Don't discard the marinade after draining the chicken. It's mixed with ¼ cup water and becomes a sauce that lightly coats the chicken and vegetables.
