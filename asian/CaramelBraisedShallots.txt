CARAMEL BRAISED SHALLOTS WITH BLACK PEPPER
Serves 4

We prefer to use shallots that are about 1 1/2 to 2 inches long and about 1 ½ inches in diameter. If using larger shallots, halve the shallots from root to tip, so that the root end keeps each half intact. We prefer an instant-read thermometer for measuring the temperature of caramel. To ensure an accurate reading, swirl the caramel to even out hot spots, then tilt the pot so that the caramel pools 1 to 2 inches deep. Move the thermometer back and forth for about 5 seconds before taking a reading. We like these shallots with roasted or grilled meats. Alternately, chop cooled shallots and use as a spread for sandwiches like grilled cheese, burgers, and BLT’s.

½ cup water
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 ½ cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 ½ pounds small shallots, peeled
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
salt and pepper
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

1. Bring water, sugar, and corn syrup to boil in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Continue to cook, without stirring until sugar at edges of pan is straw colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, swirling gently, until caramel is dark golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. (Caramel will register 365 to 370 degrees.)

2. Off heat, carefully stir in broth and butter (mixture will bubble and steam). Add shallots, thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. (Caramel does not need to be fully dissolved.) Return skillet to heat and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until shallots are tender, 12 to 14 minutes.

3. Remove cover and gently boil until sauce has consistency of maple syrup, 9 to 12 minutes. Add vinegar and cook, swirling occasionally, until sauce has returned to consistency of maple syrup, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
