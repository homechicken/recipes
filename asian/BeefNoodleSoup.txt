Beef Noodle Soup
serves 4

2T neutral oil
2 lbs boneless beef shank meat, rinsed and cut into 1" pieces
4t kosher salt
1 1/2 T minced fresh ginger
1 1/2 T minced garlic
1 T sriracha, optional
2 T soy sauce
2 whole star anise
1 cinnamon stick
2 T shaoxing wine
1 T brown sugar
1 T rice vinegar
10 c water
1 T hondashi

For serving:
4 baby bok choy, cut in half lengthwise
8 oz rice noodles
1/8 t sesame oil

Heat a dutch oven over medium-high heat then coat with the neutral oil. Season the beef with 3 t salt. Add ginger and garlic and stir. After 30 seconds, add the beef and the spices (chili bean paste, soy sauce, star anise, cinnamon, wine, sugar, and vinegar). Stir everything for a minute or so to mix thoroughly, then add the water and hondashi and stir to help it dissolve.

Bring the pot up to a simmer, then drop the heat to maintain a gentel bulling simmer. Skim any froth that rises to the surface of the broth in the first 10 minutes, adding a ladleful of water in place of each ladle of fat and scum you remove and discard. Partially cover the pot and simmer gently until the meat is tender, about 2 hours. At this point the soup can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 3 days.

To serve, bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the bok choy until tender, a minute or so, then drain well and divide among 4 serving bowls. Boil the noodles in the same pot of water according to package directions. Drain and put them in the bowls. Season the broth with the remaining 1 tsp salt and the sesame oil and portion it out over the noodles and greens. Eat hot.
