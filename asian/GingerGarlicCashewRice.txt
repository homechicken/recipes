Ginger Garlic Spiced Cashew Rice

1½ cups basmati rice
3 tablespoons salted butter, cut into 3 pieces
1 cup roasted cashews
1 cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
6 white or green cardamom pods
3 bay leaves
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1-2 Fresno or serrano chilies, stemmed, halved, seeded and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
5 medium garlic cloves, finely grated
¼ cup lightly packed fresh cilantro, roughly chopped

DIRECTIONS
In a medium bowl combine the rice and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Soak for 15 minutes. Drain the rice in a fine mesh strainer, then rinse under cool water and drain again; set aside.

In a large saucepan over medium, heat the butter until foaming. Add the cashews, cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, bay and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion, chili(es), ginger, garlic and 1½ teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 2 minutes, stirring to coat the grains with butter.

Stir in 2½ cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce to low, cover tightly and cook undisturbed for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, remove the lid, drape a kitchen towel across the pot, then replace the lid. Let stand for 10 minutes. Fluff and stir the rice with a fork. Remove and discard the bay and cinnamon, then taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with cilantro.

Tip: Don’t allow the onion, chili(es), ginger and garlic to brown. The flavor of the spices is more pronounced and the pilaf looks and tastes cleaner if the aromatics are just softened, not caramelized.
