Japanese Curry

1½ pounds boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut into ½-inch chunks
¼ cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon garam masala
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more if needed
2 tablespoons mirin
2 large carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced ¼ inch thick
½ ½ cup thinly sliced scallions, for garnish

DIRECTIONS
In a medium bowl, toss the beef with the flour until well coated and no flour remains. In a large pot over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the beef, reduce to medium and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.

Add the onion and ginger. Cook, stirring, until the onion has softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the curry and garam masala, then cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the broth, soy sauce and mirin, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally and maintaining a simmer, until a skewer inserted into the beef meets no resistance, about 25 minutes.

Add the carrots and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, then taste and season with additional soy sauce, if needed. Top with the scallions.
Tip: Don’t slice the carrots much larger than ¼ inch or the sauce will over-reduce and become too thick by the time the carrots are tender.
