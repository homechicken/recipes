Homemade Coconut Milk

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

Homemade coconut milk is easy to make and can be stored for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. Some recipes call for blending shredded coconut milk with cold water before straining out the milk, but we found that near boiling water did the best job. Since the milk tends to curdle if it’s heated to a simmer, we add a touch of baking soda. This makes the milk more alkaline and discourages milk proteins from clumping.
