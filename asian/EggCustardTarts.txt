Egg Custard Tarts
12 tarts

1/3 c sugar
1/3 c water
2 large eggs
1/2 c milk
1/4 t vanilla
kosher salt
1 package puff pastry, thawed.
flour

Heat oven to 350. Dissolve sugar in water in a small bowl, whisk in the eggs, milk, vanilla, and a pinch of salt.

Unfold the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll to a 1/3" thickness then punch out 3-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or glass. Press into muffin tin and trim excess. Poke pastry with a fork. A lot.

Bake pastry for 10 minutes, so it is slightly pufed and hard to the touch but not browned. Remove from oven and gently press back any bubbles. Reduce oven temperature to 325.

Divide custard among the tart shells, return to the oven and bake until the custards are set, 25-30 minutes. Remove and cool completely before eating.
