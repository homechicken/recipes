Ginger Beef Marinade

This recipe comes from Ron’s mom

¾ c soy sauce
½ c sugar
¼ c olive oil
3 garlic cloves
Minced ginger
¼ c wine or sherry

Use with sliced flank steak, dredge in flour, then egg, then flour again and fry in vegetable oil.

Thoughts:
Olive oil is strange for an asian recipe, try sesame oil
How much minced ginger? At least as much as there is garlic
Use rice vinegar instead of wine?
Cook with carrots and bell peppers sliced thin, garnish with green onions
