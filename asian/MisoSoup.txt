Miso Soup
serves 4

1/4 c red miso paste
1 T hondashi dissolved in 4 c simmering water
2 shiitake mushroom caps, sliced thinly
3 oz silken tofu, cubed

Whisk the miso with 2 tablespoons of the hondashi liquid until dissolved. Pour the remaining hondashi liquid into a medium saucepan and warm to a bare simmer over medium heat. Stir the dissolved miso into the dashi.

Add mushrooms, tofu, and scallions to the broth and gently simmer until everything is warm, about 3 minutes.
