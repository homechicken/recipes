Teriyaki Chicken Kebabs with Grilled Bok Choy

We brush the teriyaki sauce on the chicken toward the end of grilling so that it stays bright and sweet rather than burning and turning bitter.

Serves 4

4	heads baby bok choy (4 ounces each), halved
1	tablespoon vegetable oil
Salt and pepper
1 ½	pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
½	pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces
½	red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
½	cup teriyaki sauce
2	teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

You will need eight 12-inch metal skewers for this recipe. Serve with rice.

1. Toss bok choy, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in bowl. Cover and microwave until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.

2. Thread 1 chicken piece, then 1 pineapple piece, then 1 onion piece onto each of eight 12-inch metal skewers. Repeat pattern 2 more times on each skewer. Season all over with salt and pepper.

3. Grill bok choy and kebabs over hot fire until bok choy is char-streaked and tender and chicken registers 160 degrees, about 10 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking. Brush 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce onto kebabs and continue to cook until lightly charred, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer kebabs and bok choy to platter, brush chicken with remaining 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve.
