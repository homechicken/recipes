Root Beer the Hard Way

16 quarts water (6 for brewing, 10 for cooling)
3 pounds honey
1/8 inch licorice stick or 2-3 star anise
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 t salt
1 oz sasparilla root
1 oz sassafras root (try to find safrole-free)
1/2 c molasses
6 c sugar
1 vanilla bean
1/4 c chopped raisins
1/8 t nutmeg
1/4 oz (about 50) juniper berries, crushed
1 oz black cherry bark
2-3 Maraschino cherries, with a little syrup
1 oz wintergreen leaves
1 pack brewing yeast

Use fresh roots if at all possible.

Bring 6 quarts of water to boil with honey, licorice, cinnamon, salt, all roots, molasses, sugar, vanilla, raisins, nutmeg, juniper berries, and cherries. Let boil for an hour. As it is cooling, add the wintergreen leaves and let them steep for a minute.

Add 10 more quarts of water (to taste) to dilute and cool the wort. Target bottling temperature is lukewarm to 95 degrees max.

Strain into bottles, leaving 1 1/2 to 2" head space. Add 6-7 grains of yeast to each bottle, then seal and shake well. Ensure there are no leaks. When using glass bottles, I like to also include one or two plastic bottles which you can squeeze to see how much pressure has built up. Store at room temperature, and check daily. Normal batches can take 2-5 days.

Root Beer the Easiest Way

4-5 gallons water
5 pounds sugar
root beer extract (I'm partial to Zatarain's)
dry ice

Mix the water, sugar, and extract together in a large bucket. Add a couple pounds of dry ice and have fun watching it. When bubbling slows you can drink it. Bonus cooling from the dry ice makes this a great portable way to make root beer at a party.
