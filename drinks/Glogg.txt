DIRECTIONS

In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, combine the brandy and raisins. Microwave until steaming but not bubbling, about 1½ minutes. Let sit for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, sugar, zest, cinnamon, ginger, figs, cardamom, cloves and peppercorns and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Cover, remove from the heat and let sit 30 to 60 minutes.

Using a fine mesh strainer, strain the brandy into the pan, reserving the raisins. Strain the brandy-spiced syrup mixture into a bowl, discarding the solids. Stir in the lemon juice and bitters. Use immediately or transfer to a jar and refrigerate for up to 1 month.

In a large pot over medium, combine the wine and concentrate and heat gently until bubbles just begin to form around the edges. Do not boil. Ladle into cups and serve garnished with brandied raisins and slivered almonds, if desired.
