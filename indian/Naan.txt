Naan

2 t instant or rapid-rise yeast
1 c warm water
2 T sugar
4 T milk
1 egg, whisked
1 t salt
3 1/2 c bread flour
4 T ghee or unsalted butter, melted

Finish with
2 T ghee or butter, melted
1 small garlic clove
Nigella seeds
Cilantro, finely chopped

Mix yeast with warm water and sugar. Cover with plastic and let bloom 10 minutes until foamy.

Whisk milk and egg together. In a large mixing bowl, add flour and salt, whisk to combine.

Add wet ingredients until combined. Do not knead.

Proof in a bowl covered with plastic wrap in a warm place until doubled in size.

Divide dough into 12 equal pieces, then shape into a ball with a smooth surface. Place on lightly-floured tray and cover loosely with a lightweight towel. Let rise in a warm place for 15 minutes or until increased in size by 50%.

Roll out 3-4mm thick naan on lightly floured surface.

Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using a paper towel unless already well seasoned, set over high heat until it just starts smoking.

Place one naan in the skillet and cook for 1-1.5 minutes until the underside is deep golden and slightly charred. Flip and cook the other side 1 minute. Brush with melted butter or ghee and set aside. Repeat with each naan. 

To make cheese naan:
Roll out naan flat, then place shredded cheese inside and wrap it up and pinch closed. With seam on table, roll naan thin again.
