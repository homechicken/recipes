Slow-Cooker Guinness Beef Stew

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2 inch chunks
- salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 onions, chopped
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 1/2 cups Guinness Draught
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 5 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes, scrubbed (about 24 potatoes)
- 1/4 cup all purpose white flour
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley


METHOD:

1. Pat the beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook half of the beef until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker insert and repeat with an additional 2 teaspoons oil and the remaining beef.

2. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil, onions, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the skillet and cook until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the broth, 1 1/4 cups of the beer, sugar, thyme, chocolate, and bay leaves and bring to a boil, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits. Transfer to the slow cooker insert.

3. Add the carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the slow cooker insert. Cover and cook on low until the meat is tender, 9 to 10 hours (or cook on high for 6 to 7 hours). Set the slow cooker to high. Whisk the flour and remaining 1/4 cup beer until smooth, then stir the mixture into the slow cooker. Cook, covered , until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves, stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
