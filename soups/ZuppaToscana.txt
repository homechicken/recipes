Zuppa Tuscana

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 pounds mild Italian sausage, ground
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 pound bacon, diced
- 1 onion, large, diced
- 1-2 tablespoon garlic, minced fresh
- 2 quarts chicken broth
- 6 red potatoes, medium, cubed
- 2 cups half and half
- 1 bunch kale, washed well, chopped, tough stems removed


METHOD:

1. In a stock pot, cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes over medium-high heat until nicely browned, about 10 minutes, stirring often. Drain and set aside.

2. Cook bacon in the same pot over medium heat until crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the excess oil, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the pot. 

3. Stir in onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

4. Pour the chicken broth into the pot with the bacon mixture. Bring to boil over high heat. Add potatoes and boil until fork tender, about 15 minutes.

5. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the half and half and cooked sausage. Allow soup to heat up for 5 minutes. Mix the kale into the soup a few minutes before serving so it softens but retains its green color.
