Burger Buns
SUMMARY:

Warning: You'll never want to buy buns in the store again.

INGREDIENTS:

- 3/4 cup lukewarm water, up to 1 cup
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 large egg
- 3 1/2 cups flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon yeast
  Topping
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted


METHOD:

1. For best results, use the smaller amount of water in humid environments (summer) and the greater amount in dry (winter), and something in between for the rest of the time.

2. Mix and knead all ingredients to make a soft, smooth dough. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours, until doubled.

3. Gently deflate the dough and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball, then flatten to about 3" across. Cover and allow to proof for an hour or until noticeably puffy.

4. Brush buns with melted butter, bake in a preheated oven at 375 for 15-18 minutes, until golden. Brush tops with butter again. Cool on a rack. SOURCE: King Arthur Flour
