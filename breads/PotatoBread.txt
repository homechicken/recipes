Potato Bread
SUMMARY:

I wanted a bread recipe to rival Bob's Red Mill's potato bread mix, because it's fantastic. But they only sell it in individual packs, and not in bulk. I read through the ingredients and made up the amounts as I went, this was my first try!

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cups all purpose white flour
- 3 1/4 teaspoons buttermilk powder
- 2 tablespoons evaporated cane juice
- 1 cup potato flakes
- 2 tablespoons canola oil, or vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons wheat gluten
- 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
- 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 3/4 cups warm water


METHOD:

Mix all ingredients together until combined. Knead 7-10 minutes in mixer. Cover and let rise until doubled. Shape into round loaf and put in a pan, spray non-stick spray on plastic wrap and cover. Proof for 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375, bake for 35 minutes.
