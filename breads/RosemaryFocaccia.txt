Rosemary Focaccia

INGREDIENTS:

  Biga
- 1/2 cup unbleached white flour
- 1/3 cup warm water
- 1/4 teaspoon yeast
  Dough
- 2 1/2 cups unbleached white flour
- 1 1/4 cups warm water
- 1 teaspoon yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped


METHOD:

1. For the biga: Combine flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl and stir until a uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 8 to 24 hours. Will keep up to 3 days in the refrigerator (allow 30 minutes to return to room temperature).

2. For the dough: Stir flour, water, and yeast into biga until incorporated, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature 30 minutes. Spray rubber spatula with cooking spray, use it to fold the partially over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Fold a total of 8 times.

3. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding, turning, and rising a total of 3 times (three 30 minute rises).

4. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Dust dough with flour and divide in half. Shape each piece of dough into a 5" round by tucking under edges. Coat two 9" round cake pans with 2 tablespoons olive oil each. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt over oil. Place round dough in pan top-side down; slide dough around pan to coat bottom and sides, then turn over. Repeat with second piece of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 5 minutes.

5. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Place a baking stone on the middle rack.

6. Using fingertips, press dough out toward edges of pan. If dough resists, let rest 5-10 minutes before trying again. Poke dough 25-30 times with a fork to pop large bubbles. Sprinkle rosemary evenly over top of dough. Let dough rest until slightly bubbly, 5-10 minutes.

7. Place pans on baking stone and reduce oven to 450. Bake until tops are golden brown, 25-28 minutes, switching pans around halfway through baking. Transfer to wire rack and cool 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pan and return to wire rack, brushing tops with and oil remaining in pan. Let cool before serving. SOURCE: ATK Feed
