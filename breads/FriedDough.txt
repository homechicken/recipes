Fried Dough

Ingredients

2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, in 1/2" cubes
3/4 cup lukewarm water

Instructions

Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.

Work in the cold butter, using a pastry blender, your fingers, or a mixer.

Stir in the warm water to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into eight pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll into a thin 5" round, about 3/8" thick.

Heat about 3/8" vegetable oil to 375°F in an electric frying pan, or in a pan over a burner. If you're using a 10" diameter pan, this is 2 cups of vegetable oil. If you're not using an electric frying pan, use a candy thermometer to take the temperature of the oil; or guesstimate it by seeing if the first piece of dough fries nicely in the time specified.

Pick up one dough disk, and carefully lower it into the pan. Let it cook for 60 seconds (it'll puff up on top and become light brown on the bottom), then flip it over and cook until light brown on the other side, about 60 seconds. You don't want to cook these too dark; they'll become overly crisp.
Remove from the oil and set on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Place in a 200°F oven to keep warm while you make the remaining fried doughs.

Serve warm, with maple syrup or cider syrup; confectioners' sugar, or cinnamon sugar; or the topping of your choice — some folks enjoy a savory version, with marinara sauce and cheese.
