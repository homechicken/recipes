Hot Cross Buns

INGREDIENTS:

  Buns
- 3 eggs, large
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 3/4 cup buttermilk, warm
- 4 cups all purpose white flour, additional 1/4 c may be needed
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 3/4 cup currants, or raisins
  Wash
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 egg
  Glaze
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
- 1 tablespoon milk


METHOD:

1. For the Buns Whisk the buttermilk, melted butter, and eggs together in a large liquid measuring cup. Combine 4 cups of the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and cinnamon in a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook. With the mixer on low speed, add the buttermilk mixture and mix until the dough comes together, about 2 minutes.

2. Increase the mixer speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If after 5 minutes, more flour is needed, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough clears the side of the bowl but sticks to the bottom.

3. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter, add the currants, and knead by hand to form a smooth round ball with evenly distributed currants. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

4. Grease a 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter, divide it into 12 even pieces. Round the pieces of dough into small, taut rolls. Arrange the rolls in the prepared baking pan and wrap tightly with greased plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until the rolls have nearly doubled in size and are pressed against one another, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

5. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Using a sharp knife, cut an X through the top 1/4 inch of each bun. Whisk the egg and water together and brush over the buns. Bake until golden and puffed, 25 to 30 minutes.

6. For the Glaze Let the rolls cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Whisk the confectionersâ€™ sugar, milk, and vanilla together then drizzle it in an X into the cut grooves of the buns. Serve warm or let cool completely.
