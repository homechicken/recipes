Brioche

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 1/4 cups bread flour
- 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 7 eggs, one lightly beaten with a pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup water, room temperature
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 16 tablespoons unsalted butter, Melted and cooled slightly


METHOD:

1. Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk 6 eggs, water, and sugar together in medium bowl until sugar has dissolved. Whisk in butter until smooth. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir until incorporated and no dry flour remains. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

2. Holding edge of dough with fingertips, fold dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 45 degrees and fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times (a total of 8 folds). Cover with plastic and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding and rising every 30 minutes 3 more times. After fourth set of folds, cover bowl tightly with plastic and refrigerate for at least 16 hours or up to 48 hours.

3. Transfer dough to well-floured counter and divide into 4 pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, pat dough into 4-inch disk. Working around circumference of disk, fold edges of dough toward center until a ball forms. Flip dough over and shape into smooth round. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover rounds loosely with plastic and let rest 5 minutes.

4. Grease two loaf pans. Put each dough ball seam side up then flatten into disk and repeat shaping process. Place 2 rounds seam side down into prepared pans and press gently into corners. Cover loaves loosely with plastic and let rise until doubled. 30 minutes before baking adjust oven rack to middle position, place a baking stone on it, and preheat to 350.

5. Remove plastic and brush loaves gently with remaining egg and salt mixture. Set loaf pans on stone and bake until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 190, 35-45 minutes. Rotate pans halfway through baking. Transfer pans to wire rack and cool 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and return to wire rack. Cool completely before slicing, if you can wait that long.SOURCE: Cook's Illustrated
