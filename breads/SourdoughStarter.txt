Sourdough Starter Refreshment
SUMMARY:

If this doesn't get your starter *at least* doubling (mine tripled!) then there's no saving it.

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup sourdough starter
- 1 cup distilled water, 80 degrees
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose white flour, 11-13% protein (bread flour) is nice


METHOD:

1. Begin in the evening, two days before you intend to use the starter:

2. Stir starter well to recombine, measure out 1 cup (9 ounces), and discard remaining starter (or give it to a friend). Place measured starter in glass bowl or container with at least 1 1/2-quart capacity. Stir in 1 cup (8 ounces) water until combined, then stir in 1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) flour until evenly moistened (mixture will be lumpy). Cover with lid or plastic wrap.

3. Let stand at room temperature 8 to 12 hours; repeat, pouring off all but 1 cup starter and feeding with 1 cup water and 1 1/2 cups flour, in the morning of the following day, and, finally, once again in the evening, letting it stand at room temperature for the entire time. The starter will be fully refreshed and ready to use the next morning, 8 to 12 hours after the last feeding.

4. Long-term starter maintenance:

5. To keep a starter alive over a long period of nonuse, store it in the refrigerator. It's best to feed it weekly, according to the instructions in step 1; let it stand at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours after feeding, then return it to the refrigerator.
