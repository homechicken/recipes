Baguettes
SUMMARY:

This is the first baguette recipe I've made that came out perfect!

INGREDIENTS:

  Starter
- 1/2 cup cool water
- 1/16 teaspoon yeast
- 1 cup unbleached white flour
  Dough
- 1 teaspoon yeast
- 1 cup lukewarm water, up to 1 1/4 cup
- 3 1/2 cups unbleached white flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, up to 2 teaspoons to taste


METHOD:

1. For the starter: Make the starter by mixing the yeast with the water and flour to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well.

2. For the dough: Mix yeast and water, then add in starter, flour, and salt. Knead until soft and somewhat smooth.

3. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover. Let rise for 3 hours, gently deflating and turning the dough over every hour.

4. Turn the dough onto a lightly greased work surface, divide into 3 equal pieces.

5. Shape each piece into a rough, slightly flattened oval, let rest 15 minutes.

6. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and seal the edges with the heel of your hand. Flatten slightly, then fold and seal again.

7. With the seam side down, gently roll the dough into a 15" log. Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased sheet or pan. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 90 minutes.

8. Preheat oven to 450. Slash each loaf 3 times diagonally, spritz with water, bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
