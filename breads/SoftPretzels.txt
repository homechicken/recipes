Soft Pretzels
SUMMARY:

Super tasty!

INGREDIENTS:

  Dough
- 2 1/2 cups unbleached white flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
- 7/8 to 1 cup warm water, Use lesser in summer, more in winter
  Topping
- 1 cup boiling water
- 2 tablespoons baking soda
- coarse kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter


METHOD:

1. Place all of the dough ingredients into a bowl, and beat until well-combined. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, until it's soft, smooth, and quite slack. Flour the dough and place it in a bag. Rest for 30 minutes.

2. While the dough is resting, prepare the topping: Combine the boiling water and baking soda, stirring until the soda is totally (or almost totally) dissolved. Set the mixture aside to cool to lukewarm or cooler.

3. Preheat oven to 375F. Prepare a baking sheet by spraying it with vegetable oil spray, or line with parchment paper.

4. Transfer dough to a lightly greased work surface and divide into eight equal pieces.

5. Allow each piece to rest uncovered for 5 minutes. Pour the baking soda water into a 9" square pan.

6. Roll each piece of dough into a long, thin rope about 28-30 inches long and twist into a pretzel shape. Place four pretzels at a time into the baking soda water and spoon water over the tops. Leave them in for 2 minutes before transferring to the baking sheet. This will give the pretzels a nice brown color.

7. Sprinkle salt over the pretzels. Allow them to rest uncovered 10 minutes.

8. Bake the pretzels for 8-9 minutes or until they are golden brown.

9. Remove the pretzels from the oven and brush them thoroughly with melted butter. Keep brushing until the butter is used up. Eat warm. SOURCE: King Arthur Flour
