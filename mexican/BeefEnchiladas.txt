Authentic Beef Enchiladas

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- salt
- 1 1/4 pounds top blade steaks, trimmed
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 onions, chopped (2 cups)
- 1 can tomato sauce, 15 ounces
- 1/2 cup water
- 8 ounces Monterey Jack or mild cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups)
- 1/3 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1/4 cup pickled jalapenos, chopped
- 12 corn tortillas, 6-inch


METHOD:

1. Combine the garlic, chili powder, coriander, cumin, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Pat the meat dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook the meat until browned on both sides, about  6 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate. Add the onions to the pot and cook over medium heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil. Return the meat and juices to the pot, cover, reduce the heat to low, and gently simmer until the meat is tender and can be broken apart with a wooden spoon, about 1 1/2 hours.

2. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heart the oven to 350 degrees. Strain the beef  mixture over a medium bowl, breaking the meat into small pieces; reserve the sauce. Transfer the meat to a bowl and mix with 1 cup of the cheese, cilantro, and jalapenos.

3. Spread 3/4 cup of the sauce in the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish. Microwave 6 tortillas on a plate on high power until soft, about 1 minute.  Spread 1/3 cup of the beef mixture down the center of each tortilla, roll the tortillas tightly, and set in the baking dish, seam side down. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and beef mixture (you may have to fit 2 or more enchiladas down the sides of the baking dish). Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas and spread to coat evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup cheese evenly over the enchiladas, wrap with foil, and bake until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until the cheese browns slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve.
