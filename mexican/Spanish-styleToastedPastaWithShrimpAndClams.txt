METHOD:

1. Combine 1T olive oil, 1t minced garlic, 1/4t salt, and 1/8t pepper in medium bowl. Add shrimp, toss to coat, refrigerate until ready to use.

2. Bring reserved shrimp shells, chicken broth, water, and bay leaf to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until broth is flavorful and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer into large measuring cup or heatproof bowl. You should have 3 cups of strained broth.

3. Toss pasta and remaining 2t olive oil in broiler safe 12-inch skillet until pasta is evenly coated. Toast pasta over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until very deeply browned and nutty in aroma, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer pasta to bowl. Wipe out pan with paper towel. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat broiler.

4. Heat vegetable oil in empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/4t salt; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is softened and beginning to brown around edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add grated tomatoes and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick, dry, and slightly darkened in color, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 2t garlic, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, saffron, and anchovy. Cook until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add pasta and stir to combine.

5. Add hot broth, 1/4t salt, and 1/2t black pepper and stir well. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly thickened and pasta is almost tender, about 6 minutes. Scatter clams over pasta, cover skillet, and cook until clams begin to open, about 3 minutes. Using wooden spoon, stir clams into pasta to partially submerge. Scatter shrimp over pasta and stir shrimp into pasta to partially submerge. Transfer skillet to oven and broil until shrimp are opaque, clams have opened, and pasta on surface is dry with crisped, brown spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over surface and serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side. SOURCE: ATK Test Recipe Mailing List
