Slow-Fried Shredded Pork

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 boneless pork shoulder roast, Boston Butt, 3 pounds; trimmed and cut into 2 inch chunks
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- salt
- 4 cups peanut oil
- 1/4 cup water, or Cola
- 2 sticks cinammon
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 lime, halved
- pepper


METHOD:

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 375 degrees. Pat the pork dry with paper towels, season with the cumin and 1 teaspoon salt, and transfer to a large Dutch oven. Add the oil, water, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaves. Juice the lime directly into the pot, then add the spent lime halves.

2. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, then transfer the pot to the oven and cook, uncovered, until the edges of the pork are well browned and the meat falls apart when prodded with a fork, about 2 1/2 hours.

3. Remove the pot from the oven and, with a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a colander set over a bowl; let drain about 10 minutes. Discard the oil. Shred the pork with two forks and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with warm corn tortillas, sour cream, minced onion, cilantro, and lime wedges.
