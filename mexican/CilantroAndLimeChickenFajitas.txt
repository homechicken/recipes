Cilantro and Lime Chicken Fajitas
SUMMARY:

I marinate the chicken overnight in the fridge, and the fresh lime juice nearly cooks the chicken on its own! These go great with home-made flour tortillas.

INGREDIENTS:

  For the marinade
- 1 1/2 pounds chicken, sliced
- 1/4 cup beer
- 1/3 cup fresh lime juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon cilantro, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground
- salt to taste
  For the fajitas
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 yellow bell pepper
- 1 onion


METHOD:

1. To prepare the marinade, add all ingredients but the chicken to a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.

2. To make fajitas, slice the onions and cook them on medium heat until they begin to soften. Strain the chicken from the marinade and add the chicken to the onions and cook until the chicken is nearly done. Add sliced peppers and continue to cook until the peppers start to soften up.
