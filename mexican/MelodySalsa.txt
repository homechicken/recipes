Melody's Salsa

1 28-oz can stewed tomatoes
4 cloves garlic
1/2 onion
cilantro
jalapeno
3 pinches salt
8 shakes oregano
20 shakes red pepper flakes
juice of 1 lime

Pour everything in a blender and buzz it til it looks done. (Doesn't take long). Add a habanero for more kick. All measurements are entirely arbitrary.
