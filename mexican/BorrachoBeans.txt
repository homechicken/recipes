1 8oz can tomatoes, smashed
1-2 fresh jalapenos, chopped
4 T taco seasoning, to taste
1 can dark Mexican beer

Cover the beans with water in a large pot. Let them soak for about 4 hours or overnight. Drain. Cut bacon in small pieces, fry in a large stock pan until limp. Add chopped onion and beans. Cover with water and boil until beans are soft. Add taco seasoning, canned tomatoes, all spices, and jalapeno. Cook for 1 hour. Add beer and cook another 30 minutes. Cooking will take at least 2 hours total. Add salt if needed.
