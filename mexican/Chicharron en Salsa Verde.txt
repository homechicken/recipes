Chicharron en Salsa Verde
(Fried pork skins in green salsa)

Makes 4 servings

12 oz tomatillos (about 8 medium, husks removed)
2 serrano peppers or 1 jalapeno pepper
1 clove garlic
1/8 whole onion, plus 1/4 onion finely chopped (use white onions)
4c water
1 T vegetable oil
2c chicharrones, broken into small pieces
salt, to taste

Place the tomatillos, peppers, garlic and 1/8 onion in a large saucepan. Cover with 4 c water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently simmer for about 15 minutes, until the tomatillos are cooked.

Allow the ingredients in the saucepan to cool, then transfer them to a blender with 2 c of the cooking water and blend until smooth. Do not add more water.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the remaining 1/4 chopped onion and cook, without browning, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the sauce and cook over high heat, stirring from time to time, until the sauce is reduced and thickened, about 6 minutes.

Stir in the chicharrones and season with salt. Continue cooking over medium heat until the chicharrones are softer. This will take 10-12 minutes, depending on the thickness and freshness of the chicharron. The fat from the pork crackling will float to the surface of the sauce. If you prefer the sauce to be thinner, add more water, about 1/2 c, while cooking.


Serve with warm corn tortillas and cooked pinto beans
