Flour Tortillas
SUMMARY:

These flour tortillas are fantastic, and after having them you'll never buy tortillas from the store again!

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cups all purpose white flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons lard, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup water, warm


METHOD:

1. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a mixer. Add butter and lard and mix under thoroughly combined. The texture should be like damp sand, and if you squeeze some in your hand it should momentarily hold its shape.

2. Add no more than 3/4 cup warm water and mix until it forms a dough. Add water in slight increments if it is too dry. Dough should be slightly sticky but mainly to itself.

3. Drop dough on to a counter and cover with a warm wet towel for a few minutes. If you're in a hurry you can skip this step.

4. Preheat a griddle to the highest heat setting or a cast iron pan to (medium high?)

5. Divide dough into round balls. Golf ball sized dough will yield a fairly small tortilla, good for soft tacos. Leave the dough covered while you roll out the first tortilla. You may need to lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin, but if the dough is right it won't stick much. Flatten a ball and roll it to a roughly round shape. The tortilla will be elastic and not tear easily. Roll them out thin, but not thin enough to see through, or buy a tortilla press.

6. Lay on to griddle and cook each side for no more than a minute. Bubbles will likely rise out of the dough, this is ideal. As each side is just starting to brown, flip and then remove. Do not overcook, they will become hard and crack when folded. Stack and wrap in a dry towel or tortilla warmer until ready to serve.
