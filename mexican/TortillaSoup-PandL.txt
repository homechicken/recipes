1 can whole tomatoes, smashed with your fingers
6 c chicken broth
cilantro, chopped fine, to taste
salt to taste

Also
Monterey jack or mild Mexican cheese

Simmer for 30-45 minutes.

Meanwhile fry corn tortillas. Drain and salt. Break them up and put the equivalent of one into the bottom of each serving bowl. Put 1/4 c grated Monterey jack cheese or a mild Mexican cheese on top of the tortillas. Add soup. Top with avocado slice, crema*, and cilantro if desired.

* Crema: 1/2 buttermilk + 1/2 cream, mixed together
