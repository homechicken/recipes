Fruit Juice Caviar

1/2 c neutral vegetable oil (grapeseed/etc, must remain liquid when chilled)
1/3 c fruit juice
1/4 teaspoon Agar agar powder (not bar or flakes)

Pour oil into a tall glass and chill. Oil must be very cold.

In a very small saucepan, bring juice and agar agar to a boil. Reduce to a gentle simmer and cook 1-2 minutes, or until agar agar has dissolved.

Let cool 3-5 minutes.

Fill a syringe or straw with juice. Drip drops one at a time into the cold oil. Little caviar orbs will form on contact with the cold oil and sink to the bottom.

Strain caviar with a fine mesh strainer, rinse well with water. Store caviar in water until ready to use. Lay on a paper towel and gently pat dry if desired.
