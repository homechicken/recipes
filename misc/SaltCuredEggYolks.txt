Salt-Cured Egg Yolks

1 pound kosher salt
1 pound sugar
12 eggs

INSTRUCTIONS
Pulse salt and sugar in food processor until evenly mixed and slightly ground, about 14 pulses. (Alternatively, salt and sugar can be processed in blender on high speed until evenly mixed and slightly ground, about 30 seconds.) Transfer 14 ounces salt mixture to 8-inch square baking pan and shake pan to create even layer. Using whole, in-shell egg, make 12 evenly spaced Â¼-inch-deep indentations in salt bed by pressing bottom of egg gently into salt mixture.

Working with 1 egg at a time, crack eggs, separate yolks from whites, and transfer yolks to indentations in salt bed. Carefully pour remaining salt mixture evenly over yolks. Wrap pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until yolks are firm and dry throughout, 6 to 7 days.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees F/93 degrees C. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Fill medium bowl with cool water. Remove yolks from salt mixture, brushing off excess, and rinse gently in water. Pat yolks dry with paper towels and transfer to wire rack. Transfer sheet to oven and bake until exteriors of yolks are dry to touch, 30 to 40 minutes.

Grate or thinly slice yolks and sprinkle on your favorite dishes, from pasta and risotto to roasted vegetables and buttered toast. (Cured yolks can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.)
