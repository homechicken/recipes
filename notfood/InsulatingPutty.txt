Insulating Putty

A fairly thin (maybe 1/4") layer of this will insulate the heat from a propane torch.

Cornstarch
Baking soda
PVA glue (white Elmer's, etc)

Combine the cornstarch with baking soda in a 10:1 ratio by weight. Add enough pva glue to turn it into a workable putty. Roll out or cover what you want to insulate, then allow to dry. Even still wet, the direct heat of a propane torch will not penetrate the putty.
