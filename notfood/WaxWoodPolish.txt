Natural Beeswax Wood Polish

2 oz pure beeswax
6 oz tung oil (or cutting board oil/wood oil)
container(s) for finished wax

Melt the beeswax in a dedicated container (it will be difficult to completely clean after this). Melt over low heat and be careful because beeswax is flammable. Slowly add in the oil. Since it is cold it will cause the wax to clump up, just keep heating and stirring and it will melt back down. Carefully pour/transfer the mixture into containers and wait for it to harden before use.

To use:
Use a dry cloth to rub some of the polish into the wood. Wait a few minutes, then come back with a clean cloth and buff it out.
