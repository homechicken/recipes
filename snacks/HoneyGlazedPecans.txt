Honey-Glazed Pecans

Note: These go real nicely with Alaskan Curried Shrimp.

1 egg white
1/3 c honey
1 T ground cinnamon
1 1/2 t ground ginger
1 1/2 t ground cumin
1/4 t salt
1/8 t black pepper
1/8 t cayenne pepper (optional)
1 lb pecans, 2-3 cups

Preheat oven to 300F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment paper.

Whisk the egg white in a large bowl until very foamy. Add the honey and continue whisking for 5-10 seconds. Add cinnamon, ginger, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne, and pecans. Mix until very well coated and spread evenly on the parchment baking sheet.

Bake for 30-35 minutes. Remove the baking sheet every 10 minutes and stir the mixture completely to ensure even baking.

Cool and store in a covered container at room temperature for up to one week.
