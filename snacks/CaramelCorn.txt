Caramel Corn
SUMMARY:

The only good thing we got from Lorien's grandmother.

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 quarts popped popcorn
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup dark karo syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda


METHOD:

1. Place popped popcorn in a large paper bag.

2. Add the other ingredients except baking soda to a microwave safe bowl and cook for 1 minute. Stir everything to combine it and cook for 1 more minute. It should be bubbling like crazy.

3. Add the baking soda and stir well. Pour over the popped corn and fold the top of the bag over and shake like mad. After a good shake, put the bag in the microwave and cook for 45 seconds. Shake it again. Put it back in the microwave again for 30 seconds and give it one last good shake. Dump out onto parchment paper, spread out and let cool. SOURCE: The Necromancer
