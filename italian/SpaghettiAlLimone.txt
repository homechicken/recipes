Spaghetti al Limone

5 tablespoons salted butter, divided
8 medium garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 cup dry white wine
12 ounces spaghetti
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest, plus 3 tablespoons lemon juice
3/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or basil
Grated Parmesan cheese, to serve

DIRECTIONS
In a 12-inch skillet over medium, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic begins to turn golden, about 1 minute. Pour in the wine and cook until reduced to about ½ cup, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.

In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Stir in 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta; cook until just shy of al dente. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking water, then drain and set aside.

Set the skillet with the garlic mixture over medium-high, stir in 1½ cups of the reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. Add the drained pasta and toss. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.

Off heat, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon black pepper, the lemon juice and zest, and the parsley. Taste and season with salt and, if needed, adjust the consistency by adding additional pasta water a few tablespoons at a time. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with grated Parmesan.
Tip: Don't cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it when it's a minute or two shy of al dente; it will continue to cook in the skillet.
