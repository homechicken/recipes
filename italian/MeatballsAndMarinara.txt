INGREDIENTS:

  Onion mixture
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 onion, minced (3 cups)
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
  Marinara
- 1 can tomato sauce, 6 ounces
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 cup water
- 4 cans crushed tomatoes, 28 ounce cans
- 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup)
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
- salt
- 1-2 teaspoon sugar
  Meatballs
- 4 slices high quality white bread, torn into pieces
- 3/4 cup milk
- 1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
- 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, minced
- 2 eggs, large; slightly beaten
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 2 1/2 pounds 80 percent lean ground chuck


METHOD:

1. For the onion mixture: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer half of the onion mixture to a large bowl and set aside.

2. For the marinara: Add the tomato paste to the remaining onion mixture in the pot and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and cook until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in the water and tomatoes and simmer over low heat until the sauce is no longer watery, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir in the cheese and basil and season with salt and sugar to taste.

3. For the meatballs: Meanwhile, adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 475 degrees. Mash the bread and milk in the bowl with the reserved onion mixture until smooth. Add the sausage, Parmesan, parsley, eggs, garlic, and salt and mash to combine. Add the beef and knead with your hands until well combined. Form the mixture into 2 1/2 inch meatballs (you should have about 16 meatballs), place on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until well browned, about 20 minutes.

4. Transfer the meatballs to the pot with the sauce and simmer for 15 minutes. Serve
