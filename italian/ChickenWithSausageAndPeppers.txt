Italian Chicken with Sausage and Peppers
SUMMARY:

This dish has a fantastic flavor that belies its simple ingredients.

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
- 2 pounds chicken breast halves, bone-in, skin-on
- salt and pepper
- 1 onion, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1 red bell pepper, large and stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/4 inch strips
- 3-5 hot cherry peppers, pickled, stemmed seeded and cut into 1/4 inch slices
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/3 cup white wine vinegar, plus 2 tablespoons
- 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth, plus 1 tablespoon
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced


METHOD:

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring to break the sausage into 1/2 inch pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a paper towel-lined plate. Remove the skillet from the heat; pour off the fat into a small bowl and reserve; wipe out the skillet with paper towels.

2. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil until smoking. Pat the chicken dry and liberally season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken skin side down and cook without moving until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn the chicken and brown on the other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large plate. Remove the skillet from the heat and pour off the fat into the bowl with the sausage fat; wipe out the skillet with paper towels.

3. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and heat 1 tablespoon  of the reserved fat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the bell pepper and cherry peppers and cook, stirring occasionally , until the bell pepper begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the sugar, 1/3 cup vinegar, and 3/4 cup broth; bring the mixture to a boil, scraping up and browned bits from the pan bottom.

4. Add the sausage, chicken, and any accumulated juices to the skillet, arranging the chicken pieces in a single layer, skin side up, on top of the peppers and onion. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 160 degrees, 18 to 22 minutes, removing the smaller pieces sooner if necessary. Meanwhile, combine the cornstarch, thyme, and remaining tablespoon broth in a small bowl.

5. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken skin side up to a platter or individual serving plates. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer the sauce mixture until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Off the heat, taste the sauce and add up to 2 tablespoons of the remaining vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce around the chicken, being careful not to pour it directly over the chicken, and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve immediately.
