Million Dollar Corn

6 Tb unsalted butter, divided
1 c baked cheddar crackers (Cheez-Its), coarsely crushed
4 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
8 medium ears shucked yellow corn
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1 1/2 tsp salt, divided
1 5.3oz package garlic and fine herb spreadable cheese (Boursin)
3 Tbsp heavy cream
1 tsp granulated sugar
1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh chives
1/2 tsp ground black pepper

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium. Add crushed crackers and cook, stirring often, until toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon into a medium heat-proof bowl and set aside. Wipe skillet clean.

Add bacon to skillet and heat over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and bacon is crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to bowl with crackers and set aside. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the skillet.

While bacon cooks, remove kernels from corn cobs and place in a large bowl. Use the back of a chefâ€™s knife to scrape corn milk from cobs into bowl with kernels; discard cobs.

Add 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter to skillet with bacon fat and heat over medium-high until melted. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add corn kernels and corn milk, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt to skillet and cook, stirring often, until just crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in spreadable cheese, cream, sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter until incorporated.

Add chives and pepper to bacon mixture and stir to combine. Sprinkle corn with bacon mixture and serve immediately.
