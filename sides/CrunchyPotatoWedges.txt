Crunchy Potato Wedges
SUMMARY:

A bit of work, but these potato wedges have a fantastic taste!

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 3/4 pounds russet potatoes, about 3 large, cut into 1/4 inch wedges
- 1/4 cup vegetable or peanut oil, plus 3 quarts for frying
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose white flour
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda


METHOD:

1. Combine the salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders, cayenne, and oregano in a small bowl.

2. Toss the potato wedges with 4 teaspoons of the spice mixture and 1/4 cup oil in a large microwave-safe bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 7 to 9 minutes shaking the bowl (without removing the plastic) to redistribute the potatoes halfway through cooking. Slowly remove the plastic wrap from the bowl (be careful of the steam) and drain the potatoes. Arrange the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and cool until they firm up, about 10 minutes. (The potatoes can beheld at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)

3. Heat the remaining 3 quarts oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat to 340 degrees. Meanwhile, combine the flour and cornstarch in a medium bowl and whisk the buttermilk and baking soda in a large bowl. Working in 2 batches, dredge the potato wedges in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Dip in the buttermilk mixture, allowing the excess to drop  back into the bowl, then coat again in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess and place on a wire rack. (The potatoes can be coated up to 30 minutes in advance.)

4. When the oil is ready, add half the coated wedges and fry until deep golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the wedges to a large bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture. Drain the wedges on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Return the oil to 340 degrees and repeat with the second batch of wedges. Serve with extra seasoning on the side.
