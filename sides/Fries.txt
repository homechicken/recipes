Oven Fries

3 T vegetable oil (go light, this ended up being a bit too much)
2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled
3 T cornstarch
Salt

Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat to 425. Generously spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Pour oil into prepared sheet and tilk sheet until the surface is evenly covered with oil. 

Halve potatoes lengthwise and turn halves cut-side down on cutting board. Slice lengthwise planks to desired thickness (1/3", more or less to preference).

Cobmine 3/4 c water and cornstarch in a large microwave-proof bowl, making sure no lumps of cornstarch remain on bottom of bowl. Microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until mixture begins to thicken. Original recice says 1-3 minutes, but my microwave turned it into playdoh at 1 minute. Remove from microwave and continue to stir until mixture reached pudding-like consistency. If necessary, add up to 2T water to achieve correct consistency.

Transfer potatoes to bowl with cornstarch mixture and toss until each one is evenly coated. Arrange on baking sheet, leaving small gaps between fries. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 12 minutes.

Remove foil from sheet and bake until bottoms of fries are golden brown, 10-18 minutes. Remove from oven, carefully flip fries over. Return to oven and bake until second side is golden brown, another 10-18 minutes. Sprinkle with salt, transfer to paper towel-lined plate and serve hot.
