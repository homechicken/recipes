Cumin-Coriander Potatoes with Cilantro (Patates Mekhalel)
Egyptian recipe

2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup white vinegar, divided
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
1/4 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil
4 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly crushed
4 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly crushed
4 medium garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons hot paprika (see note)
2 teaspoons honey
1 1/2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped

DIRECTIONS

In a large saucepan over high, combine the potatoes, ¼ cup of vinegar, 2 tablespoons salt and 6 cups water. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the potatoes meets no resistance, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle with the remaining ¼ cup vinegar and toss; set aside.

In a small saucepan over medium-high, combine the oil, cumin and coriander, then cook, frequently swirling the pan, until sizzling, 45 to 90 seconds. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until it just begins to turn golden, about 30 seconds. Off heat, stir in the paprika and honey, then pour the mixture over the potatoes. Add the cilantro, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and toss. Let stand at room temperature for at least 10 minutes or up to 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Tip: Don't overcook the potatoes; the chunks should be tender but not fall apart. Also, don't allow the garlic to brown in the oil or its flavor may be acrid and bitter. Remove the pan from the heat as soon as the garlic begins to turn golden and immediately add the paprika and honey, which lower the oil's temperature.
