Lemon Potatoes

2 pounds baby red potatoes, scrubbed and halved (quartered if large)
2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed, plus 2 cloves minced
1 1/2 t grated lemon zest
2 T lemon juice
1 c low-sodium chicken broth
salt and pepper
2 T extra virgin olive oil
2 T finely chopped fresh parsley

Rinse off any dirt and drain potatoes. Bring potatoes, smashed garlic, lemon juice, chicken broth, and 1/2 t salt to boil in a large nonstick skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until potatoes are just tender, 12-15 minutes. Remove lid and increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.

Discard garlic cloves and add oil to pan. Turn all potatoes cut-side down and continue to cook until deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley, lemon zest, and minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
