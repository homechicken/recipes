Garden Fresh Corn

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 zucchini, ends trimmed and diced
- 5 medium ears of corn
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh chives, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- (null) salt and pepper


METHOD:

1. Cut the kernels from the fresh ears, then use the back of the knife to scrape all the "milk" from the cobs.

2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the zucchini and cook until softened and browned at the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the corn and cook until deep yellow and softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off the heat, stir in the herbs and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
