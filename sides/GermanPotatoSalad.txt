Authentic German Potato Salad
SUMMARY:

We were looking for a German potato salad recipe that would rival Daanan's Deli in Coeur d'Alene. After several failed attempts, this one brought home the bacon.

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 cups potatoes, peeled and diced
- 4 slices bacon
- 1 onion, small, diced
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon parsley


METHOD:

1. Boil potatoes in a pot of water for 10 minutes or until potatoes are easy to pierce with a fork. Drain and set aside to cool.

2. Crisp bacon in skillet at medium high until browned. Remove bacon and set pan aside.

3. Add onion to the bacon fat and cook over medium heat until browned. Add vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and pepper to pan. Bring to boil, then add potatoes and parsley. Crumble in the bacon. Heat throughout, then transfer to a serving dish.
