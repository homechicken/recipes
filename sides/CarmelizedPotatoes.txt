Carmelized Potatoes

2 ¼ pounds firm, small potatoes
1 T salt per quart of cooking water
½ c sugar
2 T butter

Rinse the potatoes, the place in a pot with just enough water to cover them. Add salt, cook for about 15 minutes, peel, and put them in the refrigerator. When peeling potatoes, be careful to leave the thin membrane under the peel intact.

Sprinkle the sugar in the bottom of a very hot pan and allow it to carmelize without stirring it. It may help to add a little water if the sugar doesn’t melt on its own.

Add the butter and allow it to froth, then mix together the sugar and the butter.

Rinse the peeled, cooked potatoes in cold water and let them drain a bit so that they are still moist. Place them in the caramel and turn them carefully until their surfaces are covered with caramel and they are warmed throughout.

The potatoes are done when they are completely reheated, golden and dark, and have a fine, bitter-tasting carmelized surface.
