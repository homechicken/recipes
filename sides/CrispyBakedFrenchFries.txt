Crispy Baked French Fries

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 russet potatoes, 6-8 oz each, peeled and cut into 1/2" thick fries
- 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon salt


METHOD:

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat to 450. Place potatoes in bowl, wrap tightly with plastic, and microwave until translucent around edges, 3-5 minutes, shaking bowl to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking. Transfer potatoes to cooling rack and thoroughly blot try with paper towels.

2. Coat rimmed baking sheet with 5 tablespoons oil. Transfer to oven and heat until just smoking, 5-7 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk remaining oil, cornstarch, and salt in large bowl. Add potatoes to bowl and toss to coat.

3. Arrange in single layer on hot baking sheet and bake until deep golden brown and crisp, 25-35 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking time. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate and blot dry with more paper towels. Serve.
