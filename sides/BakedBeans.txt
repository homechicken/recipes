Sweet and Smoky Baked Beans

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 ounces bacon, cut int 1/4 inch slices
- 1 onion, large, finely chopped
- 3 cans navy or great northern beans, 15.5 oz, cooked
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons molasses
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons barbecue sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
- coarse salt and pepper


METHOD:

1. Place the bacon and onion in a large nonreactive saucepan over medium heat and cook until the bacon fat renders and the onion is golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Pour off any excess fat.

2. Stir in the beans, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, barbecue sauce, vinegar, and liquid smoke.  Gently simmer the beans until thick and richly flavored, 10 minutes, adding 2 or 3 tablespoons water if necessary to keep the beans from burning.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as necessary.  Stir in the jalapenos during the last 5 minutes of cooking if desired.

3. Note: If you have time, you can simmer the beans for 5 minutes, then spoon them into an aluminum foil pan and bake in a 350F oven or in a covered grill set up for indirect grilling and preheated to medium, until thick and richly flavored, about 30 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to tast and jalapenos, if desired. SOURCE: James Hall
