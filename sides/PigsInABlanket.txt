Pigs in a Blanket
SUMMARY:

For cheddar pigs, fold in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. For salsa pigs, reduce cream to 1 1/4 cups and add 1/4 cup salsa to cream, then stir into flour mixture.

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 1/4 cups all purpose white flour
- 4 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cut into 1/2 inch pieces and chilled
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 egg, large, lightly beaten
- 6 hot dogs


METHOD:

1. Mix 2 cups flour, shortening, baking powder, salt, and cayenne until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in cream until combined. On lightly floured surface, knead until smooth, 8-10 times.

2. Roll dough into 15x10-inch rectangle. Brush dough with egg and cut into six 5-inch squares. Place remaining flour in shallow dish. Pat hot dogs dry with paper towels and coat with flour, shaking off excess. Arrange 1 hot dog in center of each dough square. Roll dough around hot dog and pinch seam closed. Cut each hot dog into 4 rounds and place on baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. (Freeze in ziplock bag up to 1 month).

3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425. Arrange rounds seam-side down. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Serve warm. SOURCE: ATK Feed
