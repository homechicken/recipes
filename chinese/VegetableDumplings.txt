Vegetable Dumplings
Serves 8

1lb napa cabbage
1t kosher salt
neutral oil
8 oz fresh shiitake mushroom caps, thinly sliced
1T minced fresh ginger
1T minced garlic
1T soy sauce
2t cornstarch
40 round dumpling wrappers

Cut cabbage lengthwise into 3 or 4 long pieces, then thinly slice crosswise to create matchstick-size pieces. Put the cabbage in a bowl and sprinkle with 1/2 t salt. Massage the salt into the cabbage and let stand until it is wilted and weeping some juice, about 10 minutes. Squeeze cabbage firmly to release as much liquid as possible. The squeezed cabbage should weigh about 8 ounces and there will be about 1 heaping cup of it.

Heat about 1 T oil in a large skilled over medium-low heat. Add the mushrooms and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 t salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mushroom liquid is drawn out and then evaporates, about 8 minutes.

Once mushrooms are tender and the pan is dry, fold into the cabbage. Cook until the mixture is dry again, but not overcooked, a couple of minutes. Scrape into bowl and let cool slightly.

Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and cornstarch to the mixture and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning. Stuff dumplings (1 scant T per wrapper) and cook as usual.
