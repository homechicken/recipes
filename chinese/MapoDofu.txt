麻婆豆腐
Spicy Sichuan Tofu and Pork

Serves 6

Don't use chili-sesame oil or sesame oil infused with chili. The sesame flavor will overpower the dish. Don't forget to drain off the excess water from the tofu before adding it to the sauce.

You can tone don the heat by omitting the chili oil and using a total of 3 tablespoons peanut oil, but don't cut back on the toban djan. Serve with steamed rice.

Ingredients
4 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons chili oil
1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil
2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
8 large garlic cloves, finely grated
6 scallions, white and light green parts minced, dark green tops thinly sliced
1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, finely ground
12 ounces ground pork
3 tablespoons chili-bean sauce (toban djan, see note)
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 14-ounce containers silken tofu, drained and cut into rough ¾-inch cubes

DIRECTIONS
In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat the chili oil and grapeseed oil until shimmering. Add the ginger, garlic, minced scallions and Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring, until the aroma of the garlic and ginger has mellowed slightly but the mixture has not browned, about 2 minutes.

Add the pork and cook, break it into small bits, until the pork is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the chili-bean sauce. Add 1¾ cups water and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Stir in the oyster sauce, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes.

Stir the cornstarch mixture to recombine. While stirring the pork mixture, pour in the cornstarch mixture. Return to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Pour off and discard any water released by the tofu, then add the tofu and half of the sliced scallions. Cook until the tofu is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining sliced scallions.
