Chinese Oil Sticks 油條

1 1/2 c all-purpose flour
2 T vegetable oil
3 t baking powder
1/2 t cane sugar
3/4 t salt
1/2 c room temp water

Sift dry ingredients together, then add the oil and water. Knead for 3-5 minutes and let rest in a warm bowl for 1 hour.

Punch dough down, then knead gently for 10 minutes. Cover and place in refrigerator overnight.

The next day, take out the dough and let it rest on your countertop for 2 hours to come up to room temperature.

Roll dough into a rectangle about 1/2" thick. Slice sticks off the short end about 2" wide, crease them down the center, then deep fry. Serve immediately.
