SUMMARY:

James and I were together in the MTC before serving different missions in Taiwan.

INGREDIENTS:

- 8 tablespoons flour, high gluten is best
- 2 1/3 tablespoons corn starch
- 220 milliliters water, 7.5 fluid ounces
- 1 pinch salt


METHOD:

1. Mix together batter ingredients and let rest 10 minutes (you can also add scallions).

2. For each pancake, beat 1 egg with 1 Tbs water and 2-3 Tbs chopped scallions and a pinch of salt.

3. Heat pan, oil lightly, pour 1/3 of batter and let it spread out into a thin pancake. When half-transparent, flip over and pour egg mixture over and spread evenly. At this point you can pour a little bit of oil on the side and shake the pan to make it go underneath, for a crispier pancake.

4. When the egg is halfway set, flip again and cook for a few more seconds. Roll up (with egg on inside or outside), transfer to plate and cut into sections. Serve with sweet/spicy sauce or thick soy sauce. SOURCE: James Hall
