Pork marinade:
2T light soy sauce
1T Shaoxing wine
500g pork belly (17 oz, just over a pound)

Cut the pork belly into ½” thick strips, then slice strips into ½” pieces. It is about half inch thick. 
Mix it with 2 tbsp of soy sauce, and 1 tbsp of Shao xing wine. Set it aside for at least 30 minutes.

Pork belly:
⅓ c Shaoxing wine
2T soy sauce
⅓ c fried shallots
3 cloves garlic
3 slices ginger
2 star anise
50g sugar (rock sugar??) 1.7 ounces
1t dark soy sauce
1t five spice powder
1.5L water

Heat up your wok. Add in your pork belly without oil. Stir fry it on medium heat.
Once you see it is getting a little burned on the bottom, then add the Shao xing wine, soy sauce, rock sugar, ginger, garlic, star anise and a pinch of five spice. Keep stirring it until the sugar melts.
Pour in 1 and half liter of water.
Add in the fried shallot we made before and add a tsp of dark soy sauce for color.
Bring it to a boil.
Turn the heat to low, let it stew for 1 -2 hours, depends on how tender you want.
After 1 and half hours the sauce still pretty thin. And there is a lot of fat floating on the top. Skim out the fat so your pork won’t be too oily.
Now you gonna turn the heat to high, start reducing the sauce. It will just take about few minutes. You will see a lot of bubbles and the sauce is getting thick.
When the sauce is almost gone, you can turn off the heat.

Serve over rice with soft boiled egg, baby bok choy.
