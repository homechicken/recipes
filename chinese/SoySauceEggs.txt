Soy Sauce Eggs
Makes 6 eggs

3T soy sauce
2T rice vinegar
1T brown sugar
1T water
1/4 t chili flakes, optional
1 star anise, optional
1/4 t black peppercorns, optional
6 large, hard-boiled eggs, peeled

Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, water, and spices in a small saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Add as many of the eggs as will fit with some room to roll around. Gently swirl the pan, rolling the eggs in the sauce. Continue rolling until the eggs are tan and infused with soy, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and cool. Refrigerate up to 2 days (after which they'll be safe but getting too salty).
