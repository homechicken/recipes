Mantou (steamed bread)

500 g flour
1/2 g baking soda
1/2 g yeast
80 g sugar about 1/2 cup or more to taste
1 1/2 - 2 tbsp margarine
warm water

Mix first two ingredients together, make a crater with them. Put yeast and sugar in middle, then add water. When thoroughly mixed, start pulling flour in from the sides, if mixture is too dry then add water. Knead mixture with palms of hands until it doesn't stick to counter anymore.

Cover mixture with a damp cloth, let rise about 10 mintues or when poked with finger it springs back up. Use rolling pin to roll mixture flat, adding flour to keep it unsticky, roll mixture until it shines and is slick like marble. Roll up tightly then roll it around like a play-doh snake to just about an inch thick, this is to seal the seam. Remember to keep the seam on bottom so that after steaming, it doesn't show.

Cut with sharp knife quickly to about 2 fingers' width, with a bit to spare. Grease pan you are steaming in, so they don't stick. Keep the little mantous apart because they rise when they are steamed. Let rise uncovered for about 20 minutes, maybe longer depending on temperature. If not given enough time to rise, mantous will split and erupt and look nasty. Steam mantous at full speed for 7-8 minutes.

Yields about 3.5 - 4 dozen little mantous

I got this recipe from the hotel kitchen of the YangGuang JiuDian I stayed at in Kunming, China. The staff were kind enough to teach me how they made their steamed buns. They had a rolling machine that made short work of laminating the dough!
