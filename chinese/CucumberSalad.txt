Chin-easy Cucumber Salad
Serves 2

1T Chinkiang vinegar
1t Sichuan chili oil
1t sesame oil
1t turbinado sugar
1/4 t salt
3 Persian or Kirby cucumbers, or 1 English cucumber
1t toasted sesame seeds
2T crushed roasted unsalted peanuts
2T cilantro leaves

Whisk vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Set the dressing aside.

Halve the cucumbers lengthwise. (If using English cucumbers, remoe the seeds with a small spoon and discard.) Set them cut-side down on a cutting board and lightly smash them: give them a couple angry thwaps with the side of a cleaver or large chef's knife until the cucumbers crack in a few places. Cut the abused cucumbers crosswise into 3/4" think half-moons.

Toss the cucumbers in the dressing, portion them out onto plates, and top each serving with sesame seeds, peanuts, and cilantro.
