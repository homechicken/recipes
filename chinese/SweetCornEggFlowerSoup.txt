1 can sweet whole kernel corn (no salt added), half liquid drained
1 1/2 cans low sodium chicken broth

Put corn and chicken broth in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to boil.

In the meantime, mix some cold water in with the corn starch. Once the soup is boiling, add in the egg mixture. Let it sit for a few seconds, then stir to break it up and distribute it. Add the corn starch mixture. Add salt and white pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh scallions.
