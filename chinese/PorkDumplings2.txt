Dumplings
Serves 8

1lb ground pork
1/4 c minced scallions
1T minnced fresh ginger
1T soy sauce
1T shaoxing wine
1t cornstarch
1t sugar
1/2 t sesame oil
white pepper
40 round dumpling wrappers
neutral oil for frying

Mix pork, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, wine, cornstarch, sugar, sesame oil, and some white pepper in a bowl.

Fill each dumpling wrapper with a scant tablespoon of filling. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water and pleat them closed. Cook right away or freeze.

To pan-fry: A heavy skillet is ideal. Add enough oil to generously coat the bottom of the pan plus a bit more. Place over medium heat and add dumplings to pan pleat-side up to cover the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is good and sizzling, count 30 seconds off then pour about 1/4 cup of water into the skillet and cover with a lid. After 3 minutes, remove the lid and poke a dumpling: the filling should be firm like a meatball and the wrapper tender. If the pan dries out add a little more water and cover again. When they are cooked, uncover and let the water boil off and the dumplings crisp and brown. They will release from the pan when done.

To boil: Boil dumplings in batches and don't crowd the pot, 10-12 at a time. They should be ready in 3-4 minutes, when the filling is firm to the touch.
