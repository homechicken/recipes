Donâ€™t walk away while heating the oil. The sesame seeds can burn in an instant, and the red pepper flakes will blacken and become bitter. The seeds should be just turning golden, and the pepper should be pleasantly fragrant.

12 ounces udon noodles, lo mein or spaghetti
5 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1/4 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil
5 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes
12 scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thinly on the bias
4 fried eggs, to serve (optional)

DIRECTIONS
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until al dente, then drain. Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and sesame oil.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium, heat the vegetable oil, sesame seeds and pepper flakes until the pepper flakes are fragrant and the sesame seeds begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in the scallion whites, then transfer the oil mixture to the bowl with the soy sauce mixture.

Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss. Add the scallion greens, reserving some for garnish, and toss. Divide among 4 serving bowl and top each with more scallion greens and a fried egg, if desired.
