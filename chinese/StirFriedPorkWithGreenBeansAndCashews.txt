Stir-Fried Pork with Green Beans and Cashews

1 c chicken broth
1/4 c mirin (sweet rice wine)
1/4 c soy sauce
3 T corn starch, divided
1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed, halved lengthwise and slices thin crosswise
3 T vegetable oil
8 oz green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
6 garlic cloves, minced
1 T ginger, freshly grated
1/4 c roasted cashews, coarsely chopped

Whisk broth, mirin, soy sauce, and 1 T cornstarch together in a bowl and set aside. Toss pork, 1 T oil, and remaining 2 T cornstarch together in a large bowl. Heat 2 t oil in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown half of pork, 3-5 minutes then transfer to a plate and brown the rest.

Add green beans and remaining 2 teaspoons oil to empty skillet and cook until bright green, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk broth mixture to recombine and add to skillet. Cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Return pork and any accumulated juices to skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with cashews and serve with rice.

I'm not sure what this is missing, but it's not much. Jacob 24 March 2021
