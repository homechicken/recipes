Technique

1. Brown the beef chunks in a few tablespoons of canola or vegetable oil over medium heat in a heavy cooking pan, about 5 minutes.

2. After meat is browned, add in tomato and onion, and stir and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

3. Add and stir in all whole spices, soy sauce and sugar.

4. Add carrots and enough water to just cover the meat and vegetables.

6. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low to simmer for 2 hours or more, stirring occasionally, until meat is fork-tender.

7. Cook noodles until al dente and add cut greens for one minute.

8. Drain noodles and greens. Reserve the cooking liquid.

9. Serve noodles into soup bowls, and spoon beef stew and broth over the noodles. Add cooking liquid from noodles to make it soupier, if desired.

10. Serve with chili sauce and preserved Chinese vegetables, if desired. Garnish with sliced green onions and cilantro sprigs.
