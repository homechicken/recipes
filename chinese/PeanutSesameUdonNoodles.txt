Peanut-Sesame Udon Noodles with Scallions

Natural peanut butter approximates the dark color and rich flavor of Chinese sesame paste, which can be difficult to find. The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to a week; bring it to room temperature before using. Check the packaging of your noodles for their cooking timing. To round out the dish, add cooked shredded chicken, poached shrimp, cubes of sauteed tofu or edamame.

Don't forget to rinse the noodles in cold water after cooking; they will become gummy otherwise.

4 Servings, 25 minutes

1/4 cup natural peanut butter
2 1/2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
4 teaspoons white miso
4 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
12 ounces dried udon noodles
3 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal (about ¼ cup)

To make the sauce, in a large bowl whisk together all ingredients; set aside.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender. Reserve ¼ cup of the cooking water, then drain the noodles. Rinse under cold water and drain again. Add the noodles and 2 tablespoons reserved cooking water to the sauce and toss until coated. Sprinkle with the scallions.
