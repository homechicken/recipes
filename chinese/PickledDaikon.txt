Pickled Daikon, Carrot, and Cucumber

1 medium carrot
1 medium cucumber (Chinese or Persian)
1/2 pound daikon radish
1 T salt
5 oz sugar
5 oz rice vinegar

peppercorns (optional)
sliced garlic (optional)
chili flakes or red peppers to taste (optional)
1/4 head chopped cabbage (optional)

Chop all veggies into bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle with salt and stir. Let sit for 30 minutes or so, until some water is coaxed out of the vegetables.

Wash off the salt and drain completely. Sprinkle with sugar, add vinegar. Cover and refrigerate 3-4 days. You can eat them as soon as the next day, but maximum flavor will take several days to develop.
