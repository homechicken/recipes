Carnitas

INGREDIENTS:

- 3 1/2-4 pounds Boneless pork butt, Trim fat cap to 1/8 inch thick, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 onion, small, peeled and halved
- 2 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 tablespoons lime juice, juice from 1 lime
- 2 cups water
- 1 orange, medium, halved
- 18 corn tortillas
- lime wedges
- 1 red onion, minced
- cilantro, fresh, chopped
- radishes, thinly sliced
- sour cream


METHOD:

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine pork, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, cumin, onion, bay leaves, oregano, lime juice, and water in large dutch oven (liquid should barely cover meat). Juice orange into medium bowl and remove any seeds, you should have about 1/3 cup juice. Add juice and orange halves to pot. Bring mixture to simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Cover pot and transfer to oven; cook until meat is soft and falls apart when prodded with fork, about 2 hours, flipping pieces of meat once during cooking.

2. Remove pot from oven and turn oven to broil. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl, remove orange halves, onion, and bay leaves from cooking liquid and discard. Place pot over high heat and simmer liquid, stirring frequently, until thick and syrupy, 8-12 minutes. You should have about 1 cup of reduced liquid.

3. Using 2 forks, pull each piece of pork in half. Fold in reduced liquid; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread pork in even layer on wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet or on broiler pan. Place baking sheet on lower-middle rack and broil until top of meat is well browned but not charred, and edges are slightly crisp, about 5-8 minutes. Using spatula, flip meat and repeat the broiling process on the other side. Serve immediately with warm tortillas and garnishes.
