Philly Cheesesteaks

INGREDIENTS:

- 6 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 onions, small, chopped
- 1 1/2 pounds sirloin tips, pounded until paper thin
- 1 pinch salt and pepper
- 8 slices provolone cheese, thin
- 4 sub rolls


METHOD:

1. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook until softened and golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to small bowl.

2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in empty skillet over high heat until smoking. Place half of steak slices in skillet (overlapping is okay) and season with salt and pepper. Cook until meat is no longer pink, about 1 minute per side. Remove pan from heat, layer 4 slices of cheese over some meat, top with more meat, and finally 4 more half-slices of cheese. Cover pan with lid to melt cheese, about 1 minute. Divide meat and cheese between 2 rolls, top with half of onions, and pour juices in skillet over meat.

3. Repeat for 2 more sandwiches. SOURCE: ATK Feed
