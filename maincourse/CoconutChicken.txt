Kenyan Coconut Chicken (kuku paka)

2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed, halved and patted dry
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil
4 medium garlic cloves, chopped
2-3 jalapeño chilies, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons ground coriander
14½ ounce can diced tomatoes
½ cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro, chopped

DIRECTIONS
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Add half the chicken in single layer and cook without disturbing until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the second sides are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, then repeat with the remaining chicken.

To the skillet, add the garlic, jalapeños, ginger and coriander, then cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Add the tomatoes with juices, scraping up any browned bits, then stir in the coconut milk and ½ cup water. Stir in the chicken and accumulated juices, then cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally and flipping the chicken, until a skewer inserted into the largest piece meets no resistance, 20 to 25 minutes; adjust the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer.

Off heat, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
