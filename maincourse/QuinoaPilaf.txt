Quinoa Pilaf with Chipotle, Queso Fresco, and Peanuts
SERVES 4 TO 6

NOTE FROM THE TEST KITCHEN If you buy unwashed quinoa, rinse the grains in a fine-mesh strainer, drain them, and then spread them on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a dish towel and let them dry for 15 minutes before proceeding with the recipe.

Ingredients

1 ½ cups prewashed quinoa
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces
1 small onion, chopped fine
1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
¾ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
1 ¾ cups water
2 ounces queso fresco, crumbled (1/2 cup)
½ cup roasted unsalted peanuts, chopped coarse
2 scallions, sliced thin
4 teaspoons lime juice

Instructions

1. Toast quinoa in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until quinoa is very fragrant and makes continuous popping sound, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer quinoa to bowl and set aside.

2. Return now-empty pan to medium-low heat and melt butter. Add onion, chile powder, salt, and cumin; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is softened and light golden, 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Increase heat to medium-high, stir in water and quinoa, and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until grains are just tender and liquid is absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking. Remove pan from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff quinoa with fork; stir in queso fresco, peanuts, scallions, and lime juice; and serve.
