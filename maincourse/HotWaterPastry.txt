Hot Water Pastry

4 cups (480g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (227g) water
8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, beef suet, or lard

Egg wash
1 large egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water

To make the pastry: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Scoop out a well in the center.

In a medium saucepan, bring the water and fat to a boil, stirring to melt the fat.

Pour the liquid into the well in the flour mixture, stirring until everything is evenly moistened and cool enough to handle comfortably (it will feel as comforting as warm towels out of the dryer).

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it a few times. Cut off one-third (about 267g) for the top and place it aside to keep warm; under the mixing bowl is a good spot.
