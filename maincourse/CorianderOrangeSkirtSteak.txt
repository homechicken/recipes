Coriander Orange Skirt Steak with Arugula

Don't use extra-virgin olive oil to cook the steak in the pan, it has too low of a smoke point. Use a neutral vegetable or grapeseed oil. You can use EVOO for the dressing.

2 tablespoons finely grated orange zest, plus 1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon garam masala
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
1 pound skirt steak, trimmed and cut crosswise into 5- to 6-inch sections, patted dry
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
5 -ounce container baby arugula

Directions
In a small bowl, stir together the orange zest, coriander, garam masala, 2½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Measure 1 tablespoon of the mixture into a large bowl; set aside. Rub the remaining mixture onto both sides of each piece of steak, massaging it into the meat. Let stand for about 15 minutes.

In a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon of oil until shimmering. Add the steak in a single layer and cook without disturbing until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the second sides are well browned and the center of the thickest piece reaches 125°F for medium-rare or 130°F for medium, another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter, tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.

To the reserve spice mixture, whisk in the orange juice, sherry vinegar, ¼ teaspoon salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the arugula, toss, then transfer to a platter. Slice the steak thinly against the grain and place on top of the arugula.
