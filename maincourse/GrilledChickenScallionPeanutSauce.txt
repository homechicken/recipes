1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
3 tablespoons warm water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, divided
1 tablespoon sriracha
3/4 teaspoon table salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and pounded 1/2 inch thick
16 scallions, trimmed

INSTRUCTIONS
Whisk peanut butter, warm water, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oil, and sriracha together in bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons peanut sauce to small bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.

Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Brush both sides of chicken with reserved 3 tablespoons peanut sauce. Brush scallions with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Grill chicken and scallions over hot fire until chicken registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes per side, and scallions are lightly charred, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken and scallions to platter, tent with foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice chicken on bias 1/2 inch thick and cut scallions into 2-inch pieces. Sprinkle with peanuts. Serve with remaining peanut sauce.
