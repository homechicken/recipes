Maque Choux

Pronounced “mock shoe,” this Creole dish from Louisiana is said to get its name from a French inflection of a Native American word for the recipe. We swapped the standard green bell pepper for an Anaheim chili, which has a bright yet earthy flavor and mild heat. If you can't find an Anaheim chili, a small poblano is a good alternative. Fresh, sweet summer corn is best, but frozen works, too. If using frozen corn, use a 1-pound bag directly from the freezer

Ingredients
1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil
12 ounces andouille sausage, halved lengthwise and cut into ½-inch pieces
2 tablespoons salted butter
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1 small red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
1 Anaheim chili, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped 
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
2 medium garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
3 cups corn kernels
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
4 scallions, thinly sliced

Directions
In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring, until well browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and discard any fat in the skillet.

Set the skillet over medium and melt the butter. Add the onion, bell pepper, Anaheim chili and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, scraping up any browned bits and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase to medium-high and add the corn, ¾ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the corn is crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

Return the sausage to the skillet, stir and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Stir in the vinegar, then taste and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the scallions.
