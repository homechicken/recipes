Skillet Chicken and Rice with Corn and Tomatoes
SUMMARY:

This has a wonderful Mexican-esque flavor from lime and cumin.

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- salt and pepper
- 4 chicken breasts, boneless, skinless
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 8 scallions, white parts minced, green parts sliced thin
- 3 ears corn, kernels removed from cob
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered
- 1 teaspoon lime zest
- 1 tablespoon lime juice, from one lime


METHOD:

1. Combine rice, 1 cup broth, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave until liquid is absorbed, 10-12 minutes (ours was ready in 5).

2. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.

3. Heat 2 T oil in the skillet. Cook scallion whites and corn until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

4. Stir rice and remaining broth into skillet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, nestle chicken into rice, and cook, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter. Stir tomatoes, lime zest, and lime juice into skillet with rice and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Stir in scallion greens and season with salt and pepper. Serve with the chicken.
