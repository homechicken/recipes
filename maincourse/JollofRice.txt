Jollof Rice

6 servings, 45 minutes

For our take on the Nigerian jollof, a one-pot rice dish, we use nutty, fragrant basmati rice seasoned with paprika, curry powder and thyme. To ensure the rice cooks evenly, use a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid. A 14½-ounce can diced tomatoes can be used in place of the plum tomatoes; no need to drain the juices.

1 pound plum tomatoes, cored and quartered
1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into quarters
2 medium garlic cloves, peeled
Kosher salt and ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained
3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped into ¼-inch pieces
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup frozen green peas

DIRECTIONS
In a food processor, combine the tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside.

In a large skillet over medium, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  Stir in the rice, then the carrots, curry powder, paprika, thyme, 1½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the rice is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in 1½ cups water, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the water has been absorbed, about 2 minutes.

Stir in the tomato puree and return to a simmer, then reduce to medium-low. Cover and cook until almost dry and the rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

Scatter the peas over the rice, then cover the pan. Remove from the heat and let stand until the remaining moisture has been absorbed and the peas are heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir the peas into the rice. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
