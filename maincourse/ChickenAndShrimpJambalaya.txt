Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya
SUMMARY:

Fantastic taste over boxed jambalaya. Although it takes more work, this recipe is 100% worth it!

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 onion, diced, medium-sized
- 1 celery ribs, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 4 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
- 8 ounces andouille sausage, cut into 1/4 inch pieces
- 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 can diced tomatoes, 14.5oz, drained, reserve 1/4 cup juice
- 1 cup clam juice
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 pound medium shrimp, shelled and de-veined
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced


METHOD:

1. You can quarter the onion, celery, and bell peppers and process them in a food processor, but if you do make sure you don't puree everything, it just needs to be coarsely chopped (along with the garlic). I find chopping them by hand and mixing in store-bought minced garlic works fine.

2. Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking, about 2 minutes. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and cook until golden brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to plate and set aside. Reduce heat to medium and add sausage; cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to paper towelâ€“lined plate and set aside.

3. Reduce heat to medium-low, add vegetables, and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon, until vegetables have softened, about 4 minutes. Add rice, salt, thyme, and cayenne; cook, stirring frequently, until rice is coated with fat, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, reserved tomato juice, clam juice, chicken broth, bay leaves, and browned sausage to pot; stir to combine. Remove and discard skin from chicken; place chicken, skinned-side down, on rice. Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir once, keeping chicken on top, skinned-side down. Replace cover and continue to simmer until chicken is no longer pink when cut into with paring knife, about 10 minutes more; transfer chicken to clean plate and set aside. Scatter shrimp over rice, cover, and continue to cook until rice is fully tender and shrimp are opaque and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.

4. While shrimp are cooking, shred chicken. When shrimp are cooked, discard bay leaves; off heat, stir in parsley and shredded chicken, and serve immediately.
