umpkin Beignets
SUMMARY:

Very light pumpkin flavor. The maple glaze is the sweetest part, the beignets themselves are not very sweet.

INGREDIENTS:

- 1/2 teaspoon yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 4 cups all purpose white flour
- 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup hot water
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- vegetable oil, for frying
  Maple Glaze
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1 cup powdered sugar


METHOD:

1. For pumpkin beignets:

2. Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 5 minutes.

3. Combine flour, pumpkin puree, sugar, heavy cream, hot water, egg, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; stir in yeast mixture. Mix dough just until combined and smooth. Let dough rest in bowl, covered with a clean kitchen towel, 30 minutes.

4. Transfer dough to a well-floured surface. Pat to about 1/4-inch thickness and cut into 2-inch squares. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free area, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

5. Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350Â°F in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Fry beignets until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turning as soon as they brown on one side.

6. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain.

7. For maple glaze:

8. Combine butter and maple syrup in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until butter melts. Whisk in powdered sugar until smooth.

9. Drizzle warm beignets with maple glaze and serve immediately.SOURCE: Disneyland Club 33
