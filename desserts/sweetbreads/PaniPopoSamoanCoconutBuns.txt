Pani Popo Samoan Coconut Buns

INGREDIENTS:

  Sweet Yeast Dough
- 3 1/2 cups unbleached white flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup powdered milk
- 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
- 3/4 cups lukewarm water
- 2 eggs, large
- 4 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
  Coconut Sauce
- 1 cup coconut milk powder
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 pinch salt


METHOD:

1. You can substitute 1 1/4 cups of coconut milk for the coconut powder.

2. Mix and knead the dough ingredients together until it forms a smooth dough, about 5-7 minutes in a mixer at low speed.

3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Rising may take longer in colder rooms. Give it enough time to become quite puffy.

4. While the dough is rising, grease a 13x9 pan.

5. Gently deflate the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and set aside to proof for 45-60 minutes. Halfway through start heating the oven to 350.

6. Alternatively, you can shape into 9 large buns in an 8x8 square pan.

7. During the last 20 minutes of rising, prepare the coconut sauce by mixing ingredients in a pan and heating at medium-high heat until slightly thickened.

8. Pour the warm sauce over proofed buns and bake for 18-25 minutes, until they are golden brown and centers register 190 on a thermometer.

9. Serve warm from the pan, scooping up the thick sauce over the buns with a spoon.
