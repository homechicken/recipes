Laura's Cinnamon Rolls

3/4 quart warm water
4 packets yeast

Dissolve yeast in water.

Add:
1 c sugar
1 c instant milk
1/2 c instant potato flakes
1 c melted butter
2 eggs
1 t salt
7-10 c flour

Keep adding flour and mix until you have a soft dough, stop when it pulls away from the sides and isn't too stick to the touch. Put dough in a greased bowl and cover with a cloth. Let rise until doubled, punch down. Allow to rise again. Roll dough out on floured surface, forming a rectangle. Put melted butter over dough, sprinkle with brown sugar and add mixed white sugar and cinnamon.

Starting on the long side, roll up tight. Cut into slices. Proof until very large. Bake 20 minutes at 350 until nice and brown.

Frosting:
1 box powdered sugar
1 stick butter, softened
1 t vanilla
Add half and half to achieve desired spread consistency
