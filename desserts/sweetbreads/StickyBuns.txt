Sticky Buns

Topping
6 Tb butter, melted
½ cup packed brown sugar
½ cup sticky bun sugar
¼ cup diced pecans (optional)

Substitute brown sugar for the sticky bun sugar, if desired

Dough
4 cups unbleached self-rising flour
2 cups heavy cream

Filling
1 cup Baker’s cinnamon filling
¼ cup water

Substitute 2/3 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon for the Baker's Cinnamon Filling and water, if desired. If you use sugar and cinnamon, DO NOT ADD THE WATER.

Preheat oven to 425 with rack in upper 3rd. Lightly grease a 9x13” pan.

To make the topping:
Pour the melted butter into the prepared pan, tilting the pan so the butter covers the bottom surface. Sprinkle the sugars and nuts on top of the butter

To make the dough:
Stir together the flour and cream to make a smooth dough. Turn it out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently roll the dough into a 24x8” rectangle.

To make the filling:
Stir together the cinnamon filling and water.

Spread the filling evenly over the dough. Roll the dough lengthwise into a log. Position it so the seam is facing down. Slice the log into 24 pieces, and place them in the prepared pan.

Bake the buns for about 25-28 minutes, until they’re bubbly and lightly browned on top.

Remove the buns from the oven, and immediately turn them out onto a serving plate. Quickly scrape any leftover syrup and nuts from the pan onto the buns.

Makes 24 sticky buns.
