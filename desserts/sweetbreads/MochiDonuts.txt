Mochi Donuts

1 c + 1 T (150g) sweet rice flour (Mochiko, Bob's Red Mill, etc)
3/4 c + 3 T (115g) tapioca starch
1 3/4 T (8g) baking powder
1/2 t (.8g) salt
1/3 c (75g) white sugar
1 large egg
5 oz (75g) whole milk
2 T (24g) vegetable shortening
neutral oil for cooking

Glaze
1c (120g) powdered sugar)
1 1/2 oz (48g) whole milk
1/2 t vanilla

Combine dry ingredients, mix well. Combine other ingredients in a large bowl and mix as well as you can (shortening will break up but not dissolve).

Sift dry ingredients into the wet bowl. Stir until fully combined.

Preheat at least 2 inches of oil in a heavy pan to 350F.

Cut parchment paper into 3x3" squares. Create a template of 8 dots, evenly spaced to help lay out the donuts. Put dough in a piping bag with a large round tip (808) and pipe out 8 teaspoon-sized balls according to the template.

Carefully lower one parchment paper of donut into the heated oil. Do not crowd your pan with too many donuts at one time. After about 1 minute, use tongs to remove the parchment, it should come off easily. Flip the donut and gently press into oil so it's submerged. Cook until it turns light brown on both sides. As it's gluten free dough, the donut won't turn a deep brown. Turn donuts out onto a paper towel-lined rack and let cool.

Mix glaze to desired thickness. Dip donut top into glaze and allow to set.
