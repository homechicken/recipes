Japanese Basic Bread Recipe
Prep Time: 2 hours
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 pieces
Ingredients
Â¾ cup plus 2 t (200ml) milk, lukewarm
0.17 oz (5g) active dry yeast
1 oz (30g) sugar
8.5 oz (240g) bread flour
2 oz (60g) cake flour
0.17 oz (5g) salt
0.35 oz (10g) dry milk powder
2 T (30g) butter, room temperature
egg wash: 1 egg plus pinch of salt, mixed well
pearl sugar
Instructions
Put lukewarm milk, yeast, and sugar in a stand mixer bowl, then whisk well. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
Combine bread flour and cake flour, and add to the milk mixture. Add salt and milk powder, and start the mixer kneading with a dough hook at medium speed.
When the dough is becoming a ball (after about 8 minutes), add soft butter and knead for another 4-5 minutes until the butter is completely incorporated. Cover with plastic, and leave in a warm place about 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size.
Take the dough and push gently to deflate the gas from the dough. Put on to a cutting board, and cut into 8 equal pieces about 2.5oz (or 70g) each. Form into small balls. Let them rest for 15 minutes covered.
Place shaped dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving 2" (or 5cm) space between the balls. Brush egg wash (the mixture of egg with a pinch of salt) on the surface of the dough, and sprinkle some sugar on top. Leave them to double in size, about 1 hour.
Bake in a preheated oven at 400F(205C) for about 9 minutes until they brown.
