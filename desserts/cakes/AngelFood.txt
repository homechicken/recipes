Angel Food Cake

Ingredients

1 cup King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or King Arthur Unbleached Cake Flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
12 large egg whites, room temperature
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract, or a combination
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Don't grease or flour your angel food cake pan. A 10" round pan or an angel food loaf pan will fit this recipe well.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg whites, salt, and extract. Beat until the mixture is just frothy, then sprinkle the cream of tartar on top and continue beating until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks.

Add the remaining sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, then gradually fold in the dry ingredients.

Spoon the batter into the pan, and bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until it's golden brown and the top springs back when lightly touched.

Remove the cake from the oven, and set it upside down with a bottle through its center cone to keep its top from flattening on the counter. Let the cake cool for 1 1/2 hours. This cooling period sets the structure, and keeps the cake from collapsing.

Loosen the edges of the cake with a knife, and remove it from the pan.

Store the cake, covered, on the counter for up to a week. Freeze, well wrapped, for up to 3 months.
