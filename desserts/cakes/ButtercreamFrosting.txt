American Buttercream Frosting

2 c unsalted butter, room temperature
1 T vanilla
1/2 t salt
7 c powdered sugar
3 T heavy or whipping cream

Beat butter on medium speed for 30 seconds until smooth. Use the a paddle attachment in a stand mixer.

Mix in vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt on a low speed.

Slowly add powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Half way through add cream to make it easier to mix. I like to place a kitchen towel over my mixer to contain any powdered sugar clouds.

Mix on low until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the desired consistency is reached.

If the frosting is too thick, add in additional cream (1 Tbsp at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add in more powdered sugar (quarter of a cup at a time).

If you plan to color the buttercream, add in the gel food coloring once the frosting is fully mixed and beat on low until it reach the desired colored
