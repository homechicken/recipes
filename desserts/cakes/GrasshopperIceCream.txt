Grasshopper Ice Cream Cake

From Cook's Country | August/September 2010

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:
When stirring the cookie crumbs into the butter for the crust of our Grasshopper Ice Cream Cake, we knew we were done when the final mixture resembled wet sand. Taking the ice cream out of the freezer a few minutes before we began to let it soften made it easier to assemble the cake. To achieve uniform layers, we needed to freeze the cake for a few hours between layers.
