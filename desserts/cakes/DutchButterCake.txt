Dutch Butter Cake (Boterkoek)

Serves 10

Don't begin beating the butter and sugar until the butter is softened, then cream the mixture for a full 3 minutes. The batter needs to be very light and fluffy before the eggs are added, or it will bake up too dense.

2 large eggs (1 egg separated)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
16 tablespoons (2 sticks) salted butter, room temperature
198 grams (1 cup) white sugar
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (1 lemon)
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
216 grams (1⅔ cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for pan

Heat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle position. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray, then dust evenly with flour, tapping out the excess. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 whole egg, the second egg yolk and the vanilla. In another small bowl, lightly beat the remaining egg white.

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, lemon zest and salt on medium-high until very light and fluffy, a full 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium-low, gradually pour in the beaten eggs, then increase to medium-high and beat, scraping down the bowl as needed, until fully incorporated, about 10 seconds. Reduce to low, gradually add the flour and mix until just combined, 10 to 15 seconds.

Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Use a small offset spatula to spread the batter into an even layer all the way to edges of the pan, then smooth the surface. Lightly brush with the egg white. Using a fork, score the surface with a crosshatch pattern. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven to 325°F and bake until golden brown and the center is firm when gently pressed with a finger, another 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Remove the pan sides and serve warm or let cool to room temperature.
