Mini Salted Maple Pies


All-purpose flour, for dusting
1 (14.1-oz.) pkg. store-bought pie dough or 2 batches homemade pie dough (for 2 crusts)
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1 large egg
1/3 cup (71 g.) packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup maple syrup (preferably dark)
1 Tbsp. heavy cream
2 tsp. cornmeal
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. pure vanilla extract
Flaky sea salt

On a lightly floured surface, roll out one round of pie dough to 1/8" thick. Using a 3 1/4" fluted cutter or drinking glass, cut out 6 rounds. Repeat with remaining dough.

Press rounds into cups of a standard 12-cup muffin tin, making sure dough is tucked into corners of each cup. Freeze 15 minutes.

Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°. Prick dough in bottom of each cup a few times with a fork.

Bake crusts until bottoms are dry and edges are lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Let sit until cool to the touch. Reduce oven temperature to 350°

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until butter is golden and smells nutty, about 4 minutes. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.

To bowl with browned butter, add egg, brown sugar, maple syrup, cream, cornmeal, kosher salt, and vanilla. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Spoon 4 tsp. maple filling into each crust.

Bake mini pies until filling is bubbly and golden around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with sea salt. Let cool completely.
