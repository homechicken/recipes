Crepes
SUMMARY:

To make really smooth batter, pour it into a blender and turn it on. This worked great for me. The amount of sugar isn't really noticeable, so you may want to add more if you really want a sweet crepe.

INGREDIENTS:

- 7 ounces flour, 3/4 cup + 2T
- 1 egg
- 17 ounces milk, 2 cups + 2T
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 pinches salt
  For sweet crepes, add
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon rum


METHOD:

1. Put the flour, salt (and sugar) in a salad bowl, dip a shaft and put the (whole) egg in. Turn with a wooden spoon and add the melted butter. Turn gently until you have incorporated all the flour (add some milk if you need but just enough). Now that the batter is soft but not liquid you have to turn very sharply so as to eliminate the lumps and obtain an homogeneous mixture. Finish pouring the milk slowly while turning.

2. Leave the batter for at least one hour before cooking.

3. To prepare : Turn the batter. Heat a non-stick pan, put a light knod of butter in (swirl the pan to distribute the melting butter; the pan must be hot enough to hear the butter fry but not too hot for the butter must not get brown!), pour a small ladle of batter on the pan while swirling it to distribute the batter evenly (this is the important trick!). Don't forget crepes must be very thin! Cook until golden brown, turn the crepe upside down and cook the other side the same way. Put it in a large plate, stuff it and fold it into 4, or roll it. Do that again for each crepe.
