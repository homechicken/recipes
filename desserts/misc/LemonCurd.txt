Easy Microwave Lemon Curd

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) butter, melted
- 2 large eggs


METHOD:

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a large microwave-safe bowl. To avoid bubble-overs, the contents should fill no more than 1/4 of the bowl; an 8-cup measure works well here.

2. Microwave the ingredients in 1-minute increments, removing from the oven and stirring to combine after each minute.

3. When curd starts to thicken; coats the back of a spoon; and starts to mound a bit as you stir, it's done. This will take anywhere from 4 to 10 minutes, depending on the strength/power of your microwave.

4. Stir the curd one more time, spoon it into a storage container, and refrigerate until firm.

5. Keep curd refrigerated for up to 3 weeks; freeze for longer storage.
