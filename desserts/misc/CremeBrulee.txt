Creme Brulee
SUMMARY:

We tried many recipes before finding this one, which comes out perfect every time.

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 cups heavy cream, chilled
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- table salt
- 1 vanilla bean, halved lenghtwise
- 12 egg yolk, large
- 8-12 teaspoons turbinado sugar


METHOD:

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat to 300 degrees.

2. Combine 2 cups cream, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan; with paring knife, scrape seeds from vanilla bean into pan, submerge pod in cream, and bring mixture to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that the sugar dissolves. Take pan off heat and let steep 15 minutes to infuse flavors.

3. Meanwhile, place kitchen towel in bottom of large baking dish or roasting pan and arrange eight 4-5 ounce ramekins on towel. Bring kettle or large saucepan of water to boil over high heat.

4. After cream has steeped, stir in remaining 2 cups cream to cool down mixture. Whisk yolks in large bowl until broken up and combined. Whisk about 2 cup cream mixture into yolks until loosened and combined; repeat with another 1 cup cream. Add remaining cream and whisk until evenly colored and thoroughly combined. Strain through fine-mesh strainer into 2-quart measuring cup or pitcher; discard solids in strainer. Pour mixture into ramekins, dividing evenly.

5. Carefully place baking dish with ramekins on oven rack; pour boiling water into dish, taking care not to splash water into ramekins, until water reaches two-thirds height of ramekins. Bake until centers of custards are just barely set and are no longer sloshy and digital instant-read thermometer inserted into centers registers 170 to 175 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes (25 to 30 if using shallow fluted dishes). Begin temperature checking about 5 minutes before recommended time.

6. Transfer ramekins to wire rack; cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Set ramekins on baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 4 days.

7. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar and carbonize with torch. Refrigerate uncovered to re-chill, 30 to 45 minutes, serve.
