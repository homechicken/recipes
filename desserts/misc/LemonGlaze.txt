Lemon Glaze

INGREDIENTS:

- 3-4 tablespoon lemon juice, 2 lemons
- 2 cups confectioner's sugar


METHOD:

1. While cake is baking, whisk together 3 tablespoons lemon juice and sugar until smooth, gradually adding more lemon juice as needed until glaze is thick but still pourable (mixture should leave faint trail across bottom of mixing bowl when drizzled from whisk).

2. After cake has been removed from pan and inverted onto wire rack set in baking sheet, pour half of glaze over warm cake and let cool for 1 hour. Pour remaining glaze evenly over cake and continue to let cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours.SOURCE: Cook's Illustrated
