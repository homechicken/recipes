Candy Canes

Ingredients: (this made 15 decent size candy canes, filled one jar with small candies, and still had some left over)

700g sugar
300g glucose syrup (corn syrup)
1/3 - 1/2 cup of water
1 teaspoon of cream of tartar (can be left out if you can't find it)
1-2 teaspoons of peppermint extract/essence
Red food colouring

Heat sugar, syrup, and water in pot over high heat, stirring to combine.

Using a candy thermometer, let the mixture boil until it hits 265 degrees. Add the cream of tartar, stir to combine.

Continue heating until mixture reaches 290 degrees. Remove from heat. Add extract and stir to combine. Pour half of mixture onto silicon pad, place pot with other half in warm oven to prevent setting up. When candy can be pulled up from the silicon mat, roll up and stretch, fold over and repeat until candy becomes opaque white. Roll into a log in a silicon mat and place in oven.

Add coloring to second half of candy in pot, and pour on silicon mat. Repeat process.

Join both pieces together, cut and stack them, then roll out again. Continue to roll into smaller threads cutting them down as needed until they are the right size. Shape and cool.
