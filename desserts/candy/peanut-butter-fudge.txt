Peanut Butter Fudge
SUMMARY:

If you double this, make sure the pot is really big. A doubled batch will overflow my 3-quart sauce pan. The liquids will triple in volume!

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup evaporated milk or light cream
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 cup mini marshmallows
- 1 1/3 cups peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla


METHOD:

1. Butter an 8-inch square pan, set it aside.

2. In a heavy saucepan combine the milk or cream, sugar, butter, and salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted and the sugar dissolves.

3. Continue heating until the mixture comes to a full, rolling boil; this is when the entire surface is covered with vigorously popping bubbles.

4. Boil without stirring for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture registers 234-236F on an instant-read thermometer.

5. When the fudge has reached the temperature, immediately remove it from the heat and stir in the marshmallows, peanut butter, and vanilla until smooth.

6. Pour the fudge into the prepared pan and allow to cool overnight at room temperature before cutting into 1-inch squares. SOURCE: King Arthur Flour
