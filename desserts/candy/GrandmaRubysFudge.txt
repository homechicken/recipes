Grandma Ruby's Yummy Fudge

3 c sugar
3 T cocoa
1/2 t salt
3 T karo light corn syrup
1 1/2 cans evaporated milk (13 oz)
1 c nuts
2 t vanilla
1/4 c butter

Heat till sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to boiling. Add lid and let sides wash down sugar crystals (about a minute).

Lower heat till it is just boiling. Continue boiling until fudge reaches the medium-firm ball stage.

Put pan into 1" water and let sit 5 minutes or so. Add butter and vanilla. Don't stir. Let cool to just warm.

Beat until color changes. Add nuts at the end. Pour into greased pan.
