Brigadeiros

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 can Sweetened condensed milk, 14 oz
- 1/2 cup dutch-processed cocoa
- 3 tablespoons butter


METHOD:

1. Combine all three ingredients in a pot over medium-low heat. Stir frequently to avoid burning. This will take about 25 minutes. When the chocolate holds a spatula-wide line, you're done.

2. Pour mixture into a greased 8x8 pan and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.

3. Pinch off tablespoon-sized pieces, roll into a ball and roll in candy sprinkles. SOURCE: ATK Feed
