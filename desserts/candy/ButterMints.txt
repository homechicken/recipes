Homemade Butter Mints

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/8 tsp salt
4 c powdered sugar
1 Tbsp heavy cream
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3/8 tsp mint extract
Food coloring, optional

Combine butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat at medium-low speed until creamy and smooth, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups sugar, cream, vanilla, and mint extract. Beat at low speed until a smooth dough forms, 1-2 minutes. With mixer on low speed, gradually add remaining 1 cup sugar, beating until dough is stiff and smooth, 1-2 minutes more.

Turn dough out on a work surface dusted with powdered sugar, knead until smooth. If desired, divide dough into multiple portions and add food coloring.

Pinch off a handful of dough and roll into 1/2-inch wide rope. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut rope into 1/2-inch pieces. Repeat with remaining dough.

Arrange cut pieces in a single layer on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Let stand uncovered at room temperature until completely dry, 8-12 hours. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
