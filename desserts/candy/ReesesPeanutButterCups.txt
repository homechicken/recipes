Gourmet Reese's Peanut Butter Cups

2 1/2 cups peanuts, shelled and husked
1 1/2 t vanilla extract
3/4 t kosher salt
1/2 c sugar
3T water
milk chocolate

Toast peanuts in oven at 350F until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes. Grind in a food processor until a smooth nut butter forms. Measure out 1c of peanut butter and transfer to stand mixer. Beat in vanilla and salt just until mixed. 

Bring sugar and water to boil in a saucepan, continue heating until sugar syrup reaches 248F. Slowly mix the sugar syrup into the peanut butter mixture and beat until mixer is cool. Drop onto parchment paper and let cool. Roll out into a slab about 1/4" thick. Cover and let rest until completely cool. Cut out circles just smaller than your cups will be. Freeze filling until ready to use.

Fill PBC cup liners with 8g of melted chocolate (put the paper on a scale) and place in a muffin tin. Tap to smooth out the chocolate. Place frozen filling circles into chocolate until it pushes up around the sides and is flush with the top of the filling. Add 3g more chocolate to top of cups and tap to flatten. Spread around with a spoon if necessary. If you get bubbles, use a torch to heat the top of the chocolate and tap the pan to even out the surface. Chill until chocolate is set.
