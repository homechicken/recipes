Microwave Peanut Brittle

1 c sugar
1/2 c light corn syrup
1 1/2 c salted peanuts
1 T butter
1 t baking soda
1 t vanilla

Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray. Mix the sugar and corn syrup together until well combined. Microwave uncovered on high power for 5 minutes.

Add the peanuts and butter and stir well to combine. Work fast so the mixture doesn't cool down too much. Return bowl to microwave and cook on high for another 2-4 minutes, stopping when the mixture turns a nice caramel color. Start watching carefully at the 2 minute mark.

Add the baking soda and vanilla. The mixture will bubble furiously when you add them. Stir quickly. Pour out onto cookie sheet and spread with a rubber spatula. Let cool completely.
