(from John Marsh - substitute any juicy fruits for the blueberries)

Vic's Blueberry Cobbler
1 stick (1/4 pound) butter
1 c flour
3/4 c sugar
2 t baking powder
1/2 t salt
1 c whole milk
1 1/2 c blueberries
cinnamon (optional)
honey (optional)

Preheat oven to 425F. Melt butter in oblong or rectangular baking dish. Mix dry ingredients and stir in milk until just absorbed, lumps are okay. Stir in berries. Pour batter into baking dish directly over melted butter. Place in oven for 20-25 minutes. Check at 15 minutes depending on size of your baking dish. Let rest 15 minutes, then spoon out to serve.

Optionally sprinkle cinnamon over batter before baking.
Optionally reduce sugar to 1/2 c, heat 1/3 c honey in microwave. When cobbler comes out of oven, pierce all over with a knife blade and drizzle honey over the top.
