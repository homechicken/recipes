MEXICAN BUÑUELOS

INGREDIENTS

For the bunuelos
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup warm water
4 tablespoons oil, plus 2 or more cups for frying

For the cinnamon sugar topping
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon


INSTRUCTIONS

Add all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Mix together until combined. Add warm water and 4 tablespoons oil. Mix together with a spoon or your hands until the dough comes together.

Transfer the dough onto a clean working surface and knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Roll the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.

While the dough is resting, cover a large plate with paper towels, fill a large saute pan with 1 to 2 inches of frying oil and make the cinnamon sugar topping. Set aside.

Divide the dough into 8 separate pieces and roll each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out each ball into an 8 to 10-inch circle. (I recommend laying the rolled out dough onto a large kitchen towel in one single layer. Don’t stack the rolled out dough on top of each other or it may stick.)

Heat the frying oil to 350°F. Fry each dough circle for about 60 seconds, turning once, until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to prepared plate to drain any excess oil. Sprinkle heavily with cinnamon sugar topping.
