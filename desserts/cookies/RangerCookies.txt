Ranger Cookies

Ingredients
1 cup vegetable shortening or butter
1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed, light or dark
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup chocolate chips
3 cups crispy rice cereal or cornflakes

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a couple of baking sheets, or line them with parchment.
Beat together the shortening, sugars, vanilla, and salt until fluffy. Add the eggs and beat until smooth.
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture and beat until well blended. Stir in the oats, coconut, chips, and cereal, mixing just until blended.
Stir in the oats, coconut, chips and cereal, mixing just until blended.
Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here.
Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they're golden brown.
Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Store completely cooled cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.
