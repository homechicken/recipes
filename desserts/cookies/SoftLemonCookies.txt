Soft Lemon Cookies

70g butter
100g sugar
zest of 2 lemons
1 egg
1 1/2 T lemon juice
150g all-purpose flour
1 t baking powder
1/4 t salt
powdered sugar
yellow food coloring (optional)

Directions

In a bowl, add your softened butter, sugar and the lemon zest. Cream the ingredients using a spatula. Once they are combined, add your egg and some yellow food coloring (this is totally optional). Now add the lemon juice and don't freak out when it curdles. Once you add the dry ingredients (sifted flour, baking powder and salt), everything is gonna come together. Mix everything until the flour is well incorporated. Refrigerate the dough for ~30 minutes.

Now form the cookies. It's easy if you have an ice cream scoop. I weighed each scoop and I got a total of 9 cookies (each one being 42g). You also need to freeze them for another ~30 minutes. After you get them out of the freezer and wait for a couple of minutes, you will be able to form some perfectly round balls.

Preheat the oven at 350F and bake them for exactly 13 minutes. Let them cool completely and coat them with powdered sugar.
