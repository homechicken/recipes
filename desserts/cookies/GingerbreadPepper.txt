Gingerbread Pepper Cookies (Pierniki)
(From Poland)

Notes: Meh. Not as good as Orange Molasses Spice Cookies.

INGREDIENTS

260 GRAMS (¾ CUP) BUCKWHEAT OR CLOVER HONEY
8 TABLESPOONS (1 STICK) SALTED BUTTER
1¼ TEASPOONS GROUND BLACK PEPPER
1 TABLESPOON GROUND GINGER
1 TEASPOON CINNAMON
½ TEASPOON GROUND CARDAMOM
210 GRAMS (1½ CUPS) RYE FLOUR
195 GRAMS (1½ CUPS) ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
½ TEASPOON BAKING SODA
1 TABLESPOON FINELY GRATED FRESH GINGER
100 GRAMS (½ CUP) PACKED LIGHT BROWN SUGAR
½ TEASPOON KOSHER SALT
1 LARGE EGG
240 GRAMS (1 CUP) TURBINADO SUGAR OR ESPRESSO GLAZE


In a small saucepan over medium, combine the honey, butter, pepper, cinnamon, ground ginger and cardamom. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then transfer to a medium bowl. Let cool until warm, 20 to 30 minutes.

In a medium bowl, whisk together both flours and the baking soda. Into the honey mixture, stir the fresh ginger, brown sugar and salt. Add the egg and mix until well combined, then stir in the flour mixture. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours.

Heat the oven to 350°F with the racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with kitchen parchment. Put the turbinado sugar, if using, in a small bowl.  Pinch off 1-tablespoon bits from the chilled dough disk and roll them between the palms of your hands into 1-inch balls. If using turbinado sugar, roll each ball in the sugar to coat evenly. Divide the dough balls between the prepared baking sheets, spacing them evenly. Lightly press each one with your hand to flatten to ¼ inch thick.

Bake until light golden brown at the edges and slightly cracked on top, 10 to 12 minutes, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. If using espresso glaze, use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies. Let the glaze dry for 30 minutes.
