In a large bowl, combine oil, butter, sugars, and zest; beat until combined. Add the egg, vanilla, and spices, beating until smooth.

Add the baking soda, powder, salt, and flour; mix until combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350. Mix the coating ingredients in a small bowl until well blended. Scoop chilled dough by the tablespoonful and roll in the sugar to coat.
