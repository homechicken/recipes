Cookie Glaze

This glaze dries hard and shiny, and is perfect for coating the top of your cookies in preparation for decorating with food-safe pens or markers. This glaze is a little on the thick side, and it isn't perfectly smooth when you apply it, but should settle into a smooth surface within half a minute or so. Glaze one cookie and set it aside for a minute. Has the glaze settled into a smooth surface? If so, it's the right consistency. Remember, it's easier to add more liquid than to stir in more sugar, so start with a glaze that's thicker than you think it should be, then add milk little by little to adjust the consistency.

2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 to 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon milk
Food coloring (optional)

Mix all of the ingredients together. Stir until smooth; a fork works fine.

The glaze should be thick, but soft enough to "settle" when you spread it. If the glaze is too thick, dribble in another teaspoon of milk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.

Add food color, if you like; gel paste food colors are preferable, as they yield vibrant color, and don't alter the liquid/sugar ratio as regular food colors might.
