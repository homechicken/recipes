Chocolate Gingerbread Cookies

2 1/4 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon King Arthur All-Purpose Baking Cocoa, or Dutch-process cocoa
1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 cup semisweet chocolate mini chips
5 tablespoons Swedish pearl sugar

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, or grease lightly.

Combine the flour, baking soda, spices, salt, and cocoa.

In a separate bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until light and creamy.

Add the molasses and beat until combined.

Beat in the dry ingredients, then stir in the chips.

Scoop the dough a tablespoon at a time; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Roll the top portion of each dough ball in pearl sugar.

Place the unbaked cookies 1 1/2" apart, sugar side up, onto the prepared baking sheets.

Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, until their surface begins to crack. Remove from the oven, cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely.

Yield: 30 to 32 cookies.
