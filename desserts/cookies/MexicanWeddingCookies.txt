Mexican Wedding Cookies
makes about 4 dozen

2 c pecans or walnuts (8oz)
2 c unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 t salt
16 T unsalted butter, softened
1/3 c superfine sugar (2.5oz)
1 1/2 t vanilla extract
1 1/2 c confectioners' sugar

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower middle positions and heat oven to 325. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.

Finely grind half of nuts in food processor to texture of coarse cornmeal, 10-15 seconds, then transfer to medium bowl. Coarsely chop remaining nuts in food processor, about 5 seconds, transfer to same bowl and stir in flour and salt.

In large bowl, beat butter and superfine sugar until light and fluffy, 3-6 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and slowly add in nut-flour mixture until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape bowl and beaters and continue to beat until dough is cohesize, about 7 seconds.

Working with 1T of dough at a time, roll dough bals and lay on prepared sheets about 1" apart. Bake cookies until pale gold and bottoms are just beginning to brown, about 18 minutes, switching and rotating trays halfway through.

Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Roll cookies 3-4 at a time in confectioners' sugar to coat.
