Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies

INGREDIENTS:

  Cookies
- 3/4 cup all purpose white flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 3 tablespoons whole milk
- 1 egg, large
- 1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, roasted and finely chopped
  Filling
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
- 1/3 cup peanuts, roasted and finely chopped


METHOD:

1. For the cookies: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. In small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. In medium bowl, whisk together butter, peanut butter, sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg. Stir dry ingredients into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed.

2. Using a 1-tablespoon scoop, portion eighteen 1-tablespoon mounds of dough onto each baking sheet. Flatten mounds with wet hand until they measure 1 1/2 inches across. Transfer to oven and bake until deep golden brown and firm to touch, about 20 minutes, switching and rotating pans halfway through baking. Remove baking sheet from oven and flatten each cookie with bottom of 1-cup measuring cup. Cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to wire rack. Cool completely before filling.

3. For the filling: Place butter and peanut butter in microwave-safe bowl and heat on high power until melted, about 40 seconds. Using rubber spatula, stir in confectioner's sugar and peanuts.

4. To assemble: Place 18 cookies upside-down on work surface. Place 1 tablespoon warm filling in center of each cookie. Place second cookie on top of filling, right side up, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Allow filling to set 1 hour before serving.
