Scottish Shortbread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, more or less to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, rounded
- 1 cup oat flour, or oatmeal
- 1 1/2 cups unbleached white flour


METHOD:

1. Preheat oven to 350.

2. Cream the butter and sugar together. Blend salt into the oatmeal and flour. Mix the butter/flour mixtures together to make a soft dough.

3. Press the dough into a round 8-inch cake pan and score the dough halfway through to divide it into multiple pieces. You can also poke divots or cut other decorations.

4. Bake for 30 minutes, until firm and barely golden. Cool before turning out of pan.
