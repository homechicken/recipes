Chocolate Shortbread

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon salt, extra fine if possible
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup Dutch-processed cocoa
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 3/4 cups all purpose white flour


METHOD:

1. Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. For thin, crisp shortbread, grease two 8" square pans. For thicker shortbread, grease one 9" square pan.

2. To avoid over-creaming, we recommend that you stir the dough by hand. In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the butter, salt, and sugar until well blended.

3. Add the cocoa, vanilla, baking powder, and flour, and mix until you have a smooth, slightly stiff batter.

4. Press the dough into your prepared pan(s) and prick all over with a fork. This will keep the shortbread from developing bubbles under the crust.

5. Bake the shortbread in two pans for 35 to 40 minutes; the single 9" pan will take about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes.

6. Invert the pan(s) over a clean sheet of parchment and turn out the shortbread. While still warm, cut each square into 12 pieces. Cool completely before serving.SOURCE: King Arthur Flour
