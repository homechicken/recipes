Dole Whip

The Disneyland app sent a notification Wednesday afternoon with the recipe for how to create a “frozen pineapple treat,” or the Dole Whip snack, through its app.

The recipe was delivered through small slides that users swiped through.

The recipe (for a single serving) reads at the following:

1 big scoop of ice cream
4 oz of pineapple juice
2 cups of frozen pineapple
Add all ingredients to a blender until it’s a thick drink.
Add your swirl and then you’re done.
