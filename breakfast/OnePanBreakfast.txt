One-Pan Breakfast

2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 T vegetable oil
salt and pepper
4 slices hearty white sandwich bread
3 T unsalted butter, softened
12 oz breakfast sausage links
4 large eggs

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Toss potatoes with salt and pepper on prepared sheet and spread into even layer. Bake until potatoes are spotty brown on tops and sides, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, spread 1 side of bread slices evenly with 2 T butter. Using 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or sturdy drinking glass, cut centers out of bread; reserve round pieces.

Remove sheet from oven, distribute sausages over potatoes, return sheet to oven and bake until sausages are lightly browned on top, about 12 minutes.

Remove sheet from oven. Using metal spatula, push potatoes and sausages into pile occupying about 1/3 of the baking sheet, creating room for bread. Place all bread, buttered side up, on empty part of sheet, bake until bread is lightly toasted on bottom, about 4 minutes.

Remove sheet from oven, remove bread, and place 1T remaining butter on pan and spread out. Flip bread and place unbuttered side into hot butter. Crack 1 egg into each bread hole and season eggs with salt and pepper. Bake until yolks have clouded over but still give slightly when touched, 3-4 minutes. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let sit until whites are completely set, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
