Light and Crispy Waffles

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 1/4 cups all purpose white flour
- 1 cup rice krispies
- 3/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil


METHOD:

1. Preheat a traditional waffle iron to medium. Meanwhile, stir the flour, rice krispies, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the egg yolks, milk, vanilla, and oil together in a medium bowl.

2. With an electric mixer or balloon whisk, beat the egg whites in a bowl to soft peaks. Pour the milk mixture over the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Whisk in the beaten whites until just combined. Do not overmix; a few streaks of the whites should be visible.

3. Pour 2/3 cup of the batter into the center of the preheated waffle iron and use the back of a dinner spoon to spread the batter toward the outer edges, stopping about a half inch from the side.
