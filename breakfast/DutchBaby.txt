Dutch Baby

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup all purpose white flour
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest, from 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 eggs, large
- 1 1/4 cups skim milk
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 3 tablespoons confectioner's sugar


METHOD:

1. Adjust oven rock to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Brush surface and sides of a large skillet with oil. Place skillet on oven rack and heat until oil is shimmering, about 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, combine flour, cornstarch, lemon zest, and salt in large bowl. Whisk eggs in another bowl until frothy and light, about 1 minute. Whisk milk, butter, and vanilla into eggs until incorporated. Whisk one-third of milk mixture into flour mixture until no lumps remain, then slowly whisk in remaining milk mixture until smooth.

3. Carefully pour batter into heated skillet and bake until edges of Dutch Baby are deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer skillet to wire rack and sprinkle Dutch Baby with lemon juice and confectioner's sugar. Cut into wedges and serve.
