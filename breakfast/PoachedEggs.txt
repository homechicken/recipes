Poached Eggs
SUMMARY:

Very silky texture!

INGREDIENTS:

- 4 eggs
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- water


METHOD:

1. Fill a skillet nearly to the top with water and add the vinegar and salt. Crack two eggs into two teacups.

2. Bring the water to a boil, then turn off the heat. Dip the teacups into the top of the water and tip the eggs out smoothly. Cover the skillet and wait 5 minutes (add 30 seconds for a firmer yolk). Remove from water with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.
