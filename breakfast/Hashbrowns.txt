Hashbrowns

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS
In developing our hash browns recipe, we began by testing potato varieties. Best were high-starch russet (baking) potatoes. They adhered well, browned beautifully, and had the most pronounced potato flavor. Grating the potatoes helped them hold together while cooking and gave us the distinctive appearance we were looking for in our hash browns recipe. We also liked the way the raw shreds of potato formed an attractive, deeply browned crust.

INGREDIENTS
1 pound high-starch potatoes such as russets or Idahos, peeled, washed, dried, grated coarse, and squeezed dry (1 ½ cups loosely packed grated potatoes)
¼ teaspoon table salt
Ground black pepper
1 tablespoon butter

INSTRUCTIONS
SERVES 4

To prevent potatoes from turning brown, grate them just before cooking. For individual servings, simply divide the grated potatoes into four equal portions and reduce cooking time to 5 minutes per side. To vary flavor, add 2 tablespoons grated onion, 1 to 2 tablespoons herb of choice, or roasted garlic to taste, to the raw grated potatoes. You can also garnish the cooked hash browns with snipped chives or scallion tops just before serving.

1. Toss fully dried grated potatoes with salt and pepper in a medium bowl.

2. Meanwhile, heat half the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it just starts to brown, then scatter potatoes evenly over entire pan bottom. Using a wide spatula, firmly press potatoes to flatten; reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until dark golden brown and crisp, 7 to 8 minutes.

3. Invert hash browns, browned side up, onto a large plate; add remaining butter to pan. Once butter has melted, slide hash browns back into pan. Continue to cook over medium heat until remaining side is dark golden brown and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes longer.

4. Fold the potato round in half; cook about 1 minute longer. Slide hash browns onto plate or cutting board, cut into wedges, and serve immediately.
