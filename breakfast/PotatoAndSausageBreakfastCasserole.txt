Potato and Sausage Breakfast Popover Casserole

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 eggs, large
- 1 cup whole milk
- salt
- 1 cup all purpose white flour
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 3/4 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, (2 potatoes) peeled and diced 1/4 inch
- 1 package sausage meat, 12 ounces
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/2 cup)


METHOD:

1. Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare a 9-inch spring-form pan and set aside on a rimmed baking sheet.

2. Whisk the eggs, milk, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl until well combined. Stir in the flour until just incorporated; the mixture will still be a bit lumpy. Whisk in the butter until the batter is smooth. Stir in the scallions and set the batter aside while preparing the filling.

3. Toss the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, cut vent holes in the plastic, and microwave on high power until the potatoes just begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, breaking up the clumps, until the meat has lost most of its pink color, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, spread the sausage evenly over the bottom of the prepared spring-form pan.

4. Heat the oil in the skillet with the sausage fat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the cooked potatoes and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until the potatoes are golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes on paper towels.

5. While the potatoes are cooking, place the spring-form pan with the sausage in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and, working quickly, sprinkle 1/4 cup of the cheese over the sausage and pour the batter evenly over the filling. Scatter the potatoes on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake until puffed and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, run a knife around the edges of the pan, and let cool 5 minutes. Release the outer ring and, using a spatula, transfer the casserole to a serving plate. Serve.
